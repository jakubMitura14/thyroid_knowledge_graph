       "'Thyroid cancer is divided into differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and undifferentiated thyroid cancer. In contrast to the undifferentiated thyroid cancer, the vast majority of the DTC accumulates iodine in the tumour cells. Utilizing this characteristic, DTC patients can undergo radioiodine therapy (RIT). RIT of DTC patients provides a very effective therapy with only minimal side effects using standard activities, which is established for more than half a century. Patients are treated according to their tumour stage. Low-risk patients usually undergo a single RIT with activities up to 4 GBq 131 I. High-risk patients undergo at least one or several RIT with higher activities [1,2]. While performing RIT with high activities of 131 I, the organs at risk need specific attention. These are the bone marrow and the lung, especially in case of multiple metastases. The amount of 131 I activity and the number of RIT depend on the results of the first RIT: if metastases were detected in the posttherapeutic scan, further RIT may be necessary for an effective treatment of metastases. Therefore, a pretherapeutic diagnostic, which detects iodine avid metastases, is desirable. The same holds for the first RIT for patients with a high likelihood for metastases. The pretherapeutic risk stratification is one of the greatest challenges in treating DTC patients. Although the overall prognosis for the most DTC patients is excellent [3], unfortunately, some DTC patients suffer from recurrences or persistent disease. These patients have already undergone RIT. In cases of recurrent or persistent disease, the cancer cells often show less up to none radioiodine uptake. Patients with low or missing radioiodine uptake would not or would only slightly benefit from an additional RIT [4]. Therefore, the knowledge of the localization and the radioiodine uptake level of lesions have great influence on therapy decision and the amount of therapeutic activity.\\nPretherapeutic imaging of DTC patients can be performed with different radioiodine isotopes and the corresponding imaging modalities. 131 I as diagnostic isotope is used since decades. Usually, activities up to 185 MBq 131 I are administered [5]. Another radioiodine isotope for pretherapeutic imaging is 123 I, which is hardly used due to its lower imaging sensitivity and higher costs [5]. Both isotopes can be visualized by planar scintigraphies with a gamma camera or as 3D imaging with a single photon emission tomography (SPECT) camera. Compared to positron emission tomography (PET), the spatial resolution of gamma cameras is lower. However, radioiodine diagnostics using 131 I prior to intended RIT is not advisable mainly for two reasons. First, until today it is not possible to derive reliable lesion dosimetry data from 131 I scans. Second, 131 I imaging needs relative high activities resulting in high radiation doses. It is well known, that this leads to a so called stunning and, thus, reduces the response of subsequent RIT [6]. 124 I PET in combination with computed tomography (CT) overcomes both problems. It offers optimal imaging to detect radioiodine uptake in tumour cells before patients undergo RIT, while only low 124 I activities are required compared to 131 I imaging [7][8][9][10][11]. Stunning is unlikely and was not reported yet [5]. In addition, pretherapeutic 124 I diagnostic provides, in comparison with 131 I and 123 I, a higher quantitative capacity to perform a reliable lesion dosimetry. This enables a tailor-made RIT with optimized absorbed tumour doses and an 131 I activity, which is considered to be safe for the patient, based on the blood dosimetry.\\nThere are two important requirements for a successful performance of124 I PET(/CT) diagnostics or RIT: First, all patients are put on a low iodine diet. This is important to increase the radioiodine uptake of the tumour cells. After performing a CT scan with contrast agents containing iodine, for example, the tumour cells are saturated with iodine and would show only a low radioiodine uptake. Therefore, any iodine contamination has to be avoided to ensure a good radioiodine uptake during diagnostic imaging or therapy. Second, the tumour cells have to be stimulated to achieve a high radioiodine uptake. The increase of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) can be reached on two ways: endogenous or exogenous stimulation. The endogenous stimulation is usually chosen after initial thyroidectomy. Patients have to stay on hormone withdrawal for about 4 weeks, until the TSH serum concentration exceeds 30 mU/l [2,5]. During this time, patients may experience hypothyroid symptoms such as fatigue, listlessness, depression and concentration disorders. The other way is an exogenous stimulation with recombinant human TSH (rhTSH). The rhTSH is administered via an intramuscular injection two and one day before diagnostic imaging or treatment. The exogenous stimulation spares patients having the hypothyroid symptoms. Moreover, a lower blood dose was reported in rhTSH stimulated patients [12,13] compared to endogenous stimulation. However, the equivalence of therapeutic efficiency concerning tumour elimination under rhTSH stimulation is not proven. 124 I is a positron emitting nuclide with a half-life of 4.2 days. Like many other positron emitting nuclides, 124 I is produced in a cyclotron. Under endogenous or exogenous TSH stimulation, 124 I can be administered in two different ways: orally or intravenously. The amount of administered 124 I activities reported in the literature is between 25 MBq and 74 MBq [7,14,15].\\nIn the time of combined PET/CT scanners, it is much easier to locate focal radioiodine uptake for example in the neck [16]. The new scanner generation provides fast scans with an acquisition time of e.g. 15 min for a scan from thigh to head. Besides the scan parameters and the scanner properties, the time point of scan is very important. In the beginning of 124 I PET(/CT) imaging, multiple scans were performed at 4, 24, 48, 72, and ≥96 h after 124 I application. This time and resource consuming approach has been optimized and the necessary scans could be reduced to 2 time points: 24 and 96 h after 124 I application [14]. The first scan 24 h after 124 I application enables the detection of focal pathological iodine uptake as correlate for metastases or local relapse. This scan is sufficient for diagnostic purpose. The first and second scans are mainly needed for lesion dosimetry to estimate the lesion absorbed (radiation) dose during RIT (details see below). However, occasionally, weakly radioiodine accumulating metastases only show uptake in the late scan.\\nThe RIT is crucial for an effective treatment of DTC [17,18]. Patients with higher initial tumour stage or advanced disease with lymph node or distant metastases routinely undergo RIT with higher 131 I activities or several RIT. The knowledge of metastases prior to first RIT would be beneficial for therapy planning. If no metastases are present, lower activities of 131 I would be reasonable. Patients with many metastases, especially bone or pulmonary metastases, should be treated carefully because of bone marrow toxicity and the risk of radiation-related pneumonitis or lung fibrosis [19,20].\\nAnother advantage of pretherapeutic 124 I PET is the re-staging and especially up-staging in patients with suspect findings in sonography. Shortly before RIT (about three weeks after thyroidectomy) patients should undergo sonography of the neck. If conspicuous lymph nodes are present, additional clarification is necessary to adapt therapy management. In this process, 124 I PET offers the possibility to detect focal iodine uptake in case of lymph node metastases and therapy activity of 131 I can be adapted. If no radioiodine uptake was found in conspicuous lymph nodes, it might be a reactive lymph node or a radioiodine negative lymph node metastasis; both will not be affected by the RIT.\\nDuring the first RIT, there is usually focal radioiodine uptake in the thyroid bed in accordance with thyroid remnant tissues. Other focal radioiodine uptake located beyond the thyroid bed is suspicious for malignancy, for example in the neck is typical for lymph node metastases.\\nIn the clinical course of patients with DTC, some patients suffer from tumour persistence after initial RIT or experience a relapse of DTC at a later stage. These patients mostly present an elevated and/or increasing serum level of thyroglobulin. Sometimes new tissue in the thyroid bed or suspect lymph nodes can be detected in sonography of the neck as a correlate. The most preferable therapy option would be an additional RIT in these cases. Unfortunately, thyroid cancer cells can dedifferentiate and partially or completely lose the ability to accumulate iodine. These patients with the so-called radioiodine negative metastases do not or only slightly profit from additional RIT. Other therapies such as surgery or external beam radiotherapy would be the therapy of choice in radioiodine negative metastases. But not all patients are radioiodine negative in case of recurrent disease. Therefore, a selection must be performed prior to futile RIT.\\nAfter initial RIT and thyroid remnant ablation, no pathological focal iodine uptake should be visible. Therefore, every focal uptake, for example in the neck or lung, is highly suspect for metastases or local relapse (except physiological uptake, e.g. in the salivary glands).\\nWithin the last years, simultaneous PET/MRI (PET/magnetic resonance imaging) has been successfully implemented into scientific and clinical imaging, demonstrating its excellent diagnostic potential, mainly in oncologic imaging. Based on its excellent soft tissue contrast, MRI is known to provide superior assessment of head and neck tumours and with the increasing implementation of integrated whole-body PET/MR devices, combining the strength of PET as well as morphological and functional MRI. In this assessment, it could be of great advantage in the localization of focal iodine uptake. The first publication about simultaneous 124 I PET/MRI showed promising results [21].\\nThe 124 I dosimetry deals with the determination of tumour lesion dose per administered 131 I activity (LDpA) and the estimation of the so-called maximum tolerable activity (MTA) of 131 I. The LDpA can help in the decision process if an additional RIT is a promising approach. If a prescribed lesion dose seems to be reachable, the RIT is combined with a significant chance of cure [22][23][24]. Due to the heterogeneity of metastases of a patient, there may be a significant spread of LDpA in the different metastases. In consequence, RIT might be helpful in some metastases and the other metastases need to be treated by surgery or external beam radiotherapy.\\nThe MTA derived from blood dosimetry is the 131 I activity that results in 2 Gy blood dose, which is used as a surrogate for the bone marrow dose. Blood doses below 2 Gy are expected to be tolerable without relevant side effects [19]. Furthermore, it is possible to evaluate the risk of radiation-related fibrosis in patients with or without disseminated lung metastases [19,20]. The blood dosimetry is based on blood sample (BS) and whole-body counter (WC) measurements (see Figures 123).   The lesion and blood dosimetry consists of measurements at different time points after application of 124 I to determine the iodine kinetics. The lesion dosimetry requires a minimum of two PET(/CT) scans at 24 and ≥96 h after 124 I application. The blood dosimetry by the EANM dosimetry committee uses a comprehensive protocol with measurements over at least 4 days [25], which was optimized and shortened by Jentzen et al. [26]. For the optimized blood dosimetry protocols, patients are divided into the groups prior to first RIT and after first RIT. Prior to initial RIT, more measurements are recommended due to the presence of thyroid tissue. After the first RIT, only three time points are sufficient. In Figure 4, the required measurements are visualized. Further details on the calculations of lesion and blood dosimetry can be found in Jentzen et al. [14,26] (see examples in Figures 5 and6).  \\n\\nMarcus Ruhlmann * , Verena Ruhlmann, Walter Jentzen and Andreas Bockisch *Address all correspondence to: marcus.ruhlmann@uk-essen.de University Duisburg-Essen, Department of Nuclear Medicine, Essen, Germany\\nThyroid cancer is divided into differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and undifferentiated thyroid cancer.

Of these two enzymes, DIO2 plays major role in the intracellular T3 availability. T3 levels in both hypothalamus and pituitary glands are the major determinant of the inhibitory control of TSH secretion and hence, DIO2 plays important role in the T4-mediated negative feedback regulation of TSH and TRH levels at pituitary and hypothalamic levels respectively [1][2][3]. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) i.e., Thr92Ala SNP (c.274A > G; T92A; rs225014) in the gene coding for DIO2 is associated with impaired peripheral T4 to T3 conversion [4]. Threonine (Thr) at 92 position of DIO2 (type II 5\\' monodeiodinase) is replaced by Alanine (Ala) due mis-sense mutation of Adenine to Guanine change ( A > G) at 274th codon in exon 2 of DIO2 gene. The rs225014 is reported to be associated with diverse physiological disorders like type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, gestational diabetes, insulin resistance, hypertension, osteoarthritis, Grave\\'s disease, intelligence quotient alterations associated with iodine de ciency, psychological well-being, and response to T3 or T4 therapy, suggesting the possible involvement of this SNP in the disruption of the thyroid hormone signalling [1,[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. DTC patients are administered with L-T4 therapy after the thyroidectomy and ablative 131 I therapy to suppress the TSH levels to inhibit the recurrence of thyroid cancer. It is speculated that the 131 I treated DTC patients harbouring the rs225014 SNP may require higher L-T4 dose for TSH suppression due to impaired DIO2 activity. There are con icting results regarding the association of Thr92Ala SNP and the requirement of the suppressive L-T4 dose in DTC patients [15][16][17]. This study was carried out to determine the frequency of Thr92Ala SNP in the DTC patients at our centre and to determine its association with thyroid function tests (TFT) results and the L-T4 dose requirement.\\nApproval from Institution Medical Ethics Committee:\\nThe study was approved by Institutional Medical Ethics Committee (RMC-IMEC-P4/Feb/2018/OPA233616).\\nThe study included two groups namely DTC and control groups respectively. The DTC group consisted of 157 thyroidectomised DTC patients (113 females and 44 males) who had undergone ablative 131 I treatment at least six months before and were on L-T4 suppressive treatment. The inclusion criteria of the patients included age ranging between10 to <70 years, undetectable Thyroglobulin (Tg) levels with negative whole-body scan for thyroid malignancy, absence of any other disease or medication affecting L-T4 absorption. L-T4 dose was taken under fasting condition in the morning. The DTC patient group was further divided into two sub-groups based on the level of TSH suppression namely suppressed TSH group and near-suppressed TSH group for comparison of L-T4 dose requirements. The TSH levels in the suppressed TSH group and near-suppressed TSH sub-groups were < 0.1 µIU/ml and ≥ 0.1 <0.5 µIU/ml respectively. The control group consisted of 69 healthy volunteers. The age and gender of the healthy volunteers was matched with the patients. The informed consent was taken from all the subjects. PCR ampli cation of exon 2 of DIO2 gene for detection of single nucleotides polymorphism (SIP) in that exon:\\nGenomic DNA was extracted by non-enzymatic salting out method. Tetra Primer ampli cation refractory mutation system Polymerase Chain Reaction (TP-ARMS PCR) was standardized based on previously reported procedure to detect Thr92Ala (c.274 A>G; T92A; rs225014) polymorphism in exon 2 of DIO2 gene [9]. The primers for amplifying A (wildtype) allele and G (mutant) allele of the DIO2 gene were as given below, Primer (A allele or wildtype \\'Thr\\' allele) FW1: ATTGCCACTGTTGTCACCTCCTTCGGT RV1: CTATGTTGGCGTTATTGTCCATGCGGTC Primer (G allele or mutant \\'Ala\\' allele) FW2: AATTCCAGTGTGGTGCATGTCTCCATTG RV2: TTTTGGGCCATTCTTTACATTACCTGCCA Each 30 µl PCR reaction mixture contained 2 µl DNA templet, 2 µl primer mix (5 pM/µl), 20 µl master mix and 6 µl nuclease free water. PCR tests were done under following programme with initial denaturation 3 min at 95°C followed by 30 cycles (30 Sec denaturation (95°C), 30 Sec annealing (60°C) and 30 Sec extension (72°C) and extra 15 min extension at the end of the 30 cycles). PCR amplicons were run on 1.5% Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (AGE) to analyse the pattern of bands to determine the type of genotypes.\\nRIA and IRMA assays for thyroid function test (TFT): TFT i.e., T4, T3, TSH, FT4, anti-TPO antibodies levels in all patients\\' as well as controls\\' serum samples were estimated by RIA and IRMA kits using SR 300 STRATEC RIA autoanalyzer.\\nThe data was expressed as mean ± S.D and median (range) for the parameters having normal and skewed distribution respectively. For statistical analysis, the deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was analyzed using χ 2 test and the difference between the groups was carried out using ANOVA using SPSS software.\\n\\nIn a single step TP-ARMS-PCR reaction, \\'A\\' allele speci c and \\'G\\' allele speci c amplicons were generated using two pairs of allele speci c primers. The combination of FW1 and RV1 primer pair generated amplicon of product size 276 bp speci c for the \"A\" (wildtype) allele and the combination of FW2 and RV2 primer pair generated amplicon of product size 418 bp speci c for \"G\" (mutant) allele. The two outer primers i.e., FW1 and RV2 generated larger amplicon of 639 bp which was not speci c for any genotype and appeared in all the samples. Hence, homozygous wild type AA (Thr/Thr) genotype showed bands at 276 bp and 639bp, homozygous GG (Ala/Ala) genotype showed bands at 418bp and 639 bp and heterozygous AG (Thr/Ala) genotype showed bands at 276bp, 418bp and 639 bp respectively which were easily differentiated on AGE as depicted in Fig. 1.\\nThe frequency of homozygous mutant (Ala/Ala) and heterozygous mutant (Thr/Ala) genotype of rs225014 SNP in DTC group was 0.27 and 0.52 respectively which was comparable with the control group in the present study (Table 1). The allele frequencies in DTC and normal group were consistent with Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). Thr92Ala SNP was not found to be associated with DTC in this study (odds ratio (OR) = 1.1; 95% con dence interval (CI) = 0.6-1.9).\\nThe results of thyroid function tests in the three genotypes of rs225014 in the DTC patients are presented in the Table 1.\\nAnalysis of the TFT in patients with three different genotypes present in the samples under study : TFT were comparable among the three genotypes except T3 and T3/T4 ratio in DTC patient\\'s group. T3 levels in the homozygous (Ala/Ala) and the heterozygous (Thr/Ala) genotypes were signi cantly lower than the wildtype Thr/Thr genotype. The T3/T4 ratio was signi cantly lower in the Ala/Ala genotype as compared to other two genotypes. TSH levels were adequately suppressed in all the three genotypes due to L-T4 suppressive therapy (Table 2). The L-T4 dose required to suppress TSH levels was marginally higher in the DTC patient subgroups harbouring the Thr92Ala genotypes (Thr/Ala + Ala/Ala) than the sub-groups harbouring the wild type (Thr/Thr) genotype. However, the difference in the L-T4 suppressive dose requirement between wild type and mutant genotypes was not statistically signi cant. (Table 3).\\nVarious factors including SNPs affect intra-individual thyroid hormone set-point and their homeostasis [18][19][20]. DIO2 is a major contributor for circulatory T3 as it has higher catalytic e ciency and lower Km than DIO1. It is also an important determinant of local T3 bioavailability and feedback regulation of pituitary TSH secretion [3]. Therefore, the SNPs associated with DIO2 are more likely to affect thyroid function parameters. The rs225014 SNP is an A/G polymorphism wherein a threonine (Thr) changes to alanine (Ala) at codon 92 is found to be more prevalent in general population [21][22][23][24]. rs225014 has been reported to be associated with decreased DIO2 enzyme activity and linked with various disorders [5-8, 11-14, 24, 25]. The frequency of homozygous and heterozygous rs225014 variants range from 0.12 to 0.34 and 0.39 to 0.60 respectively in the patients\\' study population from different ethnicity [5-7, 9, 14, 16]. In the present analysis, the frequency of homozygous and heterozygous rs225014 variants in DTC patients\\' group was 0.27 and 0.52 respectively which was at higher side, however, was comparable to the frequency observed in the patients from the Indian origin [9]. There are con icting reports about the association of rs225014 SNP with serum thyroid hormone levels. No association between the Thr92Ala SNP and thyroid hormone levels was not detected in some of the reports [10,16,23,26,27]. However, Thr92Ala SNP was found to be associated with a thyroid hormone level in some of the reports. Castagna et al demonstrated that rs225024 reduced DIO2 activity and serum T3 levels in thyroid de cient patients [21]. Butler et al reported that the homozygous status for the rs225014 allele was associated with a decreased TSH stimulated release of T3 from the thyroid in healthy subjects, indicative of a lower intra-thyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 and was also clinically associated with traits of impaired thyroid hormone action at various end organ targets, the hypothalamic-pituitary level and in circulating levels of thyroid hormones [4]. In the present study, no changes in the serum T4, FT4 and TSH levels were observed among all three genotypes of rs225014 SNP. However, serum T3 levels and the T3/T4 ratio was signi cantly lower in the DTC patients with homozygous Ala/Ala allele indicating impaired T4 to T3 conversion. The reduction in the T3 and T3/T4 ratio were detected in the homozygous rs225014 carriers in the previous study carried out in the type 2 diabetic patients as well [9]. No association between DIO2 SNP and thyroid cancer manifestation was observed in this study which is in accordance with previous studies [15,16,28]. Thyroidectomised DTC patients lack inherent T3 production and hence, entirely depend on the DIO1 and DIO2 enzymes for catalytic conversion of L-T4 to T3. DTC patients are given L-T4 therapy to suppress TSH activity to keep the remnant malignant thyroid tissues dormant so as to inhibit the recurrence of thyroid cancer. However, DTC patients harbouring rs225014 may require higher L-T4 to suppress TSH when compared to patients without the SNP due to difference in DIO2 gene makeup.\\nTherefore, it would be important to identify the patients harbouring rs225014 SNP so as to explore whether there is a requirement of redesigning of the standard L-T4 suppressive therapy protocol. There are con icting reports about the effect of rs225014 on the L-T4 dose requirement to suppress TSH in DTC patients. Torlontano et al and AlRasheed et al have speculated that DIO2 SNPs may have an important role in determining the L-T4 dose requirement in thyroidectomised & 131 I treated DTC patients [15,28].\\nTorlontano et al reported that the homozygous Rs225014 variant was associated with approximately 20% higher L-T4 dose requirement to suppress TSH levels in DTC patients [15]. However, Heemstra et al and Santoro et al did not nd any association between rs225014 and higher L-T4 dose requirement [16,17]. In the present study, the L-T4 dose requirement was marginally higher in both the DTC subgroups who were harboring rs225014 SNP than the non-carriers. However, the observed difference in L-T4 dose requirement between the SNP carriers and the non-carriers was not statistically signi cant. Nevertheless, the nature of the present study was preliminary and large number of DTC patients need to be screened for con rmation regarding the possible variation in the L-T4 dose requirement in the patients harbouring the rs225014 SNP. In addition, it would be important to analyse the synergistic effect of SNPs on the TSH suppressive L-T4 dose if more than one SNPs are co-existing in DTC patients. Identi cation of the DTC patients\\' genetic susceptibility for differential response to L-T4 therapy would prevent delay in the evaluation of precise personalised TSH suppressive dose, and hence, would prevent the chances of recurrence or metastasis of the thyroid cancer. Nonetheless, it is essential to analyse the in uence of genetic alterations in the DTC patients for the precise implementation of the L-T4 therapy or for exploring the implementation of the combination of L-T3 and L-T4 therapy in the susceptible patients to achieve required extent of the TSH suppression.\\nThe allele frequency of rs225014 SNP was observed at a higher side in the DTC patients, however, no association between the rs225014 and DTC was observed. The reduced ratio of T3/T4 in the DTC patients harbouring homozygous variant of rs225014 indicated impaired DIO2 catalysed T4 to T3\\nconversion in the present study. This suggested that the thyroidectomised DTC patients carrying homozygous rs225014 SNP variant may require higher L-T4 dose to suppress TSH levels due to impaired T4 to T3 conversion in the absence of any other compensatory mechanisms. The screening for rs225014 in the DTC patients showing reduced response to TSH suppression would enable quicker decisionmaking in the implementation of personalized L-T4 dose and save the patients from development of any adverse effects. Nevertheless, it is essential to do a detailed study of impact of the SNPs associated with the DIO2 enzyme activity on the thyroid function and the treatment in the patients from different ethnic origins, as it is a key component in the thyroid hormone signalling pathway.\\nThe authors declare that no funds, grants, or other support were received during the preparation of this manuscript.\\nThe authors have no relevant nancial or non-nancial interests to disclose.\\nAll contributed to the study conception and design.

DTC is an uncommon disease clinically, but worldwide, its incidence shows a noticeable increase [1]. Consecutive autopsy studies have shown that papillary microcarcinoma is frequent in the general population. Improved detection of some of these subclinical tumours may account for at least part of the increase in DTC incidence [2].\\nWhen appropriate treatment is given, the prognosis of the disease is generally excellent. Although the 10-year survival rate in cases of distant metastasis is approximately 25-40% [3][4][5], the 10-year overall cause-specific survival for DTC patients as a whole is estimated at approximately 85% [6,7]. However, the lifetime recurrence rate is relatively high, reaching 10-30% [7][8][9][10] in some series. Therefore, lifelong follow-up is needed in all DTC survivors and subsequent therapy in an appreciable number of patients. Because DTC survivors number approximately 250,000 in Europe alone [11], DTC management has notable patient quality-of-life (QOL) and pharmacoeconomic implications. This state of affairs has driven the elaboration of various national and international DTC management guidelines from diverse medical specialty organisations, reflecting the multi-disciplinary approach required for the care of DTC [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19].\\nWith the present paper, the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) seeks not simply to contribute to the series of publications but to focus on practical aspects of radioiodine therapy (RAIT) of DTC. Efforts have been made to harmonise our recommendations with those of the European Thyroid Association guidelines [12], and the lead author of those guidelines has critically reviewed this article. However, in the area of RAIT, the nuclear medicine specialty can offer unique experience and perspectives, and as a result, valuable advice to the clinician.\\nIt should be noted that the level of evidence regarding therapy (as well as diagnosis and follow-up) of DTC patients is low in many instances, as has been documented in the 2006 American Thyroid Association guidelines [13]. The relatively low prevalence of the malignancy and the lengthy overall survival of most patients create the need for large sample sizes and very long-term follow-up to demonstrate outcome differences between interventions. This, in turn, hinders the execution of large-scale prospective studies, especially on new therapies. In light of this dilemma, in developing their recommendations, the authors have relied significantly on their clinical experience to supplement the observations reported in the literature. In the interests of simplicity, clarity and relevance to everyday practice, the authors have provided citations to key studies underlying their recommendations rather than formally classifying strength of evidence for proposed treatment strategies.\\n\\nRAIT is defined as the systemic administration of 131sodium or potassium iodide ( 131 I) for selective irradiation of thyroid remnants, microscopic DTC or other nonresectable or incompletely resectable DTC, or both purposes. Based on the primary goal of the RAIT, there are two main forms of the procedure.\\nThe first form, radioiodine ablation, is a post-surgical adjuvant modality. It seeks to eliminate thyroid remnants to increase the sensitivity and specificity of follow-up testing for DTC persistence or recurrence, namely, of assays of serum thyroglobulin (Tg) as a tumour marker and of diagnostic whole-body scintigraphy (dxWBS). Ablation also allows sensitive \"post-therapy\" whole-body scintigraphy (rxWBS) that may detect previously occult metastases [15] and serves to treat any microscopic tumour deposits. Ablation, therefore, may reduce long-term morbidity and possibly, mortality [15,20,21]. Ablation success is evaluated 6-12 months after the ablation procedure with current definitions of such success including the following criteria: & on follow-up dxWBS, negative thyroid bed uptake or thyroid bed uptake beneath an arbitrarily set, low threshold, e.g. 0.1%, & absence of detectable thyroid-stimulating hormone-(TSH-) stimulated Tg antibodies has been excluded, & absence of suspicious findings on neck ultrasonography (US) [22,23].\\nThe second form of RAIT, radioiodine treatment of nonresectable or incompletely resectable lesions, e.g. microscopic disease, macroscopic local tumour or lymph node or distant metastases, is performed as curative or palliative therapy either as a component of primary treatment of DTC or to address persistent or recurrent disease.\\n\\nDue to the generally favourable prognosis of DTC, the impact of radioiodine ablation on disease-specific mortality and relapse rate is hard to substantiate. Few randomised studies address this topic, and some of these studies are inconclusive. However, a recent meta-analysis documented the positive influence of RAIT as an adjunct to thyroidectomy, namely, in retrospective studies with follow-up of 10 years or more [20]. When thyroid surgery is performed in highly expert hands at selected tertiary referral centres, though, the positive influence of radioiodine ablation may not be apparent [24].\\nRadioiodine ablation after total or near-total thyroidectomy is a standard procedure in patients with DTC. The only exception is patients with unifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma ≤1 cm in diameter who lack: & evidence of metastasis, & thyroid capsule invasion, & history of radiation exposure, & unfavourable histology: ○ tall-cell, columnar cell or diffuse sclerosing subtypes.\\nIn these cases without the above risk factors, completion thyroidectomy or RAIT of large remnants may be avoided. When such patients have been treated by total or near-total thyroidectomy, some centres refrain from radioiodine ablation under the rationale that this procedure would not materially improve an already excellent prognosis. Other centres consider radioiodine ablation as a means of improving follow-up and potentially decreasing relapse risk [25,26]; potential risk factors for recurrence or mortality, such as family DTC history, tumour size, history of neck radiation exposure, histology, closeness of the tumour to the thyroid capsule, presence of vascular invasion and, in the future, thyroid cancer-related molecular genetic findings, should be considered when deciding whether to perform radioiodine ablation in these patients.\\nWhen radioiodine uptake is scintigraphically proven before therapy or after empiric RAIT, radioiodine treatment of non-resectable or incompletely resectable tumour, e.g. local recurrences, lymph node metastases or disseminated iodineavid lung metastases or other distant lesions, has shown in various investigations to be effective in eradicating disease, slowing disease progression or providing symptomatic relief [4]. Indeed, outcome has been shown to be superior in patients with radioiodine-avid metastases compared to those with radioiodine-negative extra-thyroidal lesions [4]. Furthermore, a recently published study using 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) suggests that FDG uptake in metastases, which typically reflects the presence of radioiodine non-avid disease, is itself a relevant independent unfavourable prognostic indicator [27]. In multivariate analysis, this study found that greater numbers of FDG-avid lesions or higher maximum standard uptake values in a patient\\'s tumours on FDG-PET correlated significantly with overall mortality [27].\\nThe results of RAIT are superior for microscopic or small macroscopic tumours than for larger lesions [4]. Therefore, the feasibility of partial or complete resection of macroscopic lesions should always be checked as a first treatment option.\\nChart 1 provides indications and contraindications for radioiodine treatment. However, the decision on whether or not to give RAIT with the intention of cure or palliation should be individualised to the patient and should consider the following factors: & Operability-except in cases of high risk of important surgical complications, excision is the preferred firstline treatment for persistent or recurrent DTC. This preference is based on the modality\\'s high potential to improve survival, especially in cases of lesions limited to the thyroid bed or neck lymph nodes, or to palliate disease and improve QOL. However, RAIT should always be offered as an adjuvant to surgery of persistent or recurrent DTC, unless the disease has been confirmed to be iodine non-avid. & Iodine avidity-RAIT exerts no benefit in the absence of iodine-avid tissue. However, lack of iodine avidity can only be confirmed through an rxWBS performed in the absence of iodine excess. & Disease site-whilst lymph node, lung and most soft tissue metastases have high rates of cure by RAIT with or without surgery, cure of bone and brain metastases is relatively rare [4,28]. & Tumour characteristics-patients with less differentiated tumour histotypes such as papillary tall-cell, columnar cell or diffuse sclerosing or follicular widely invasive, poorly differentiated or Hürthle cell have a greater risk of relapse and a reduced survival, yet despite diminished NIS expression, such tumour may respond well to RAIT [29]. Metastatic DTC has a highly variable rate of  [30]. & Potential risks of the procedure-whilst RAIT is generally well-tolerated, it is not without potential short-and long-term toxicity (Table 1), which includes second primary malignancy [31]. These potential risks should be weighed against the expected benefits of the intervention. \\n\\nAs a matter of terminology, the amount of radioiodine given in a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, expressed in Becquerels (Bq) or Curies (Ci), should be referred to as an \"activity\". The term \"absorbed dose\" or the shorter version, \"dose\", should be reserved to describe the radiation absorbed by an organ, tissue or body compartment, expressed in Gray (Gy). RAIT activities are generally empirically determined and fixed by a given institution based on disease characteristics and patient age (see Appendix 1 for the discussion of dosimetry-based activities). The \"optimal\" activity for radioiodine ablation of post-surgical thyroid residues macroscopic disease is generally a single administration of 1-5 GBq, but within that range, remains controversial, with different centres advocating use of 1.11, 1.85 or 3.7 GBq [32]. A recent systematic review concluded that current evidence does not yet allow the determination whether ablation success rates are similar with ablation activities of 1.11 versus 3.7 GBq [32].\\nFor radioiodine ablation in children, some centres adjust activity by body weight (e.g. to 1.85-7.4 MBq/kg) or surface area or by age (e.g. to 1/3 the adult activity in a 5year-old, 1/2 the adult activity in a 10-year-old, or 5/6 the adult activity in a 15-year-old) [33]. Another approach, recommended in the German procedure guidelines for radioiodine therapy in paediatric DTC patients [16], is to adjust the ablation activity according to the 24-h thyroid bed uptake of a test activity of radioiodine as well as according to body weight: <5% uptake would warrant an activity of 50 MBq/kg, 5-10% uptake would warrant an activity of 25 MBq/kg and 10-20% uptake would warrant an activity of 15 MBq/kg. Because it maximises the degree of individualisation, flexible ablation dosing according to one or more individual patient body characteristics, i.e. weight, surface area, thyroid bed radioiodine uptake, appears to be a preferable strategy to fixed dosing or to flexible dosing based on age.\\nIn general, the rationales for individualising radioiodine activities to a lower than adult level in paediatric patients are children\\'s longer life expectancy, and hence, vulnerability to undesired treatment effects, and the greater absorbed dose to bone marrow and extra-thyroidal tissue in children, given their smaller body sizes and the increased cross-radiation due to shorter distances between organs [34].\\nIn cases where ablation success criteria (see the \"Definition and goals\" section) are not met, one or more additional ablation activities may be considered. \"Watchful waiting\" is another alternative, especially in patients with small persistent residues, which appear to have no impact on clinical outcome. In patients with large persistent remnants, re-operation may be an option.\\nIn late adolescents and adults, inoperable iodine-avid distant metastases are typically treated with multiple administrations, each 3.7-7.4 GBq or more, given every 4-8 months during the first 2 years following diagnosis of metastatic disease and at longer intervals thereafter [35][36][37][38]. In children, some clinicians use fixed activities of 1.1 to 11.0 GBq, whilst others use variable empirical activities ranging from 37.0 to 92.5 MBq/kg of body weight [16,33]. In the paediatric radioiodine treatment setting, a fixed dosing scheme of similar activities to those used in adult patients appears to be preferable. Such a Liberal hydration, use of lemon juice, sour candy and chewing gum in the 24+ h after radioiodine administration [80,81] Chronic dry eye Rare strategy has the virtue of simplicity and may maximise the chances of complete response in a population in whom persistent tumour cells would have a particularly long time to progress to clinical recurrence or to de-differentiate. However, in using standard fixed activities in this setting, caution should be exercised to avoid inappropriately high absorbed doses to lung parenchyma (e.g. in patients with high lung radioiodine uptake) or bone marrow [39,40].\\nAs an alternative to the administration of fixed RAIT activities in adult or paediatric patients, pre-therapeutic dosimetry (see Appendix 1) may be used to calculate an individualised activity projected to deliver a desired amount of radioactivity to tumour or extra-thyroidal compartments, or both. The generally accepted absorbed dose thresholds providing high efficacy are ≥300 Gy to remnants or ≥80 Gy to tumour deposits [41]. The generally accepted surrogate dose threshold to avoid serious myelotoxicity is a blood absorbed dose ≤2 Gy [42]. Some centres combine the lesion-and blood-based dosimetric approaches [43]; however, larger patient series are warranted to further support this strategy. The EANM Dosimetry Committee recently published a standard operating procedure guideline on how to tailor the activity to be administered for systemic treatment of DTC so that the absorbed dose to blood does not exceed 2 Gy [44].\\nWhether giving radioiodine ablation or treatment, the clinician must bear in mind that severe renal failure abrogates whole-body radioiodine clearance [45,46]. Absent renal dialysis, virtually all the administered activity will remain in the patient for a protracted time; therefore, in patients with renal failure, dialysis should be carried out within 24 h following radioiodine administration.\\nRAIT should continue until no evidence remains of iodine-avid disease, until intolerable toxicity develops or until the patient refuses this treatment modality. There is no maximum limit for the cumulative 131 I activity that can be given to patients with persistent iodine-avid disease. However, most remissions are obtained with cumulative activities ≤22 GBq [4]; above this threshold, continued RAITs should be considered on an individual basis. Post-RAIT transplantation of stem cells obtained autologously before RAIT appears to be a promising tool to allow continued RAIT resulting in high cumulative activities, e.g. 50 GBq, when such RAIT is the only treatment option. Outcomes of this strategy merit further investigation. In some patients with iodine-avid tumour who did not achieve a complete response to several RAITs but have clearly stable disease (e.g. no clinical signs of progression or increasing Tg levels), the intervals between RAITs may be increased, or RAIT may be halted in favour of \"watchful waiting\".\\nBecause of the greater ease to the patient and the superior radiation protection for caregivers, 131 I generally should be administered orally as a capsule. Before administration, the actual therapeutic activity should be measured using an activimeter to confirm that it matches the planned activity.\\n\\nThe effectiveness of RAIT depends on the patient\\'s serum TSH level being sufficiently elevated. A TSH level of ≥30 mU/L is believed to increase NIS expression and thereby to optimise radioiodine uptake [13]. Such TSH elevation can be reached by waiting at least 3 weeks after thyroidectomy or 4-5 weeks after discontinuing treatment with levothyroxine (LT4). Triiodothyronine (LT3) may be substituted for LT4 until 2 weeks before RAIT in an attempt to decrease the duration of hypothyroidism; however, systematic data on the impact of interim LT3 medication are still lacking. When thyroid hormone is withheld, it should be initiated or resumed 2 days after radioiodine administration.\\nNonetheless, traditional thyroid hormone witholding or withdrawal (THW) has the major drawback of causing weeks to months of hypothyroid symptoms in most patients [47][48][49][50]. Such physical and psychological morbidity may include fatigue, depression, impaired ability to concentrate, sleep disturbance, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, hoarseness, puffy face or hands, cardiovascular abnormalities, impaired renal function and exacerbation of dyslipidemia [48,[51][52][53][54][55][56]. These manifestations in turn frequently significantly decrease patient QOL, cause absenteeism from or impaired performance in work or study or lead to debilitating or even life-threatening worsening in psychological, cardiovascular, renal or other concomitant conditions [47][48][49][50][57][58][59][60][61].\\nA few studies suggest that a shorter period of THW may effectively elevate TSH whilst mitigating hypothyroid disturbance in adults [62] or children [63]; however, this strategy has the disadvantages with respect to patient adherence and convenience and to health care costs of requiring multiple physician visits and TSH determinations. Additionally, a shorter THW fails to elevate TSH in an appreciable percentage (approximately 10%) of adults [62], and it is not always possible to predict which individuals will fail to respond to abbreviated THW.\\nAn alternative to THW for attaining TSH elevation is rhTSH administration. In Europe and elsewhere, this drug has been approved for use in adults as preparation for serum Tg testing, dxWBS or both or for radioiodine ablation [22,57,58,64]. Based on the regimen and patient characteristics in the pivotal phase 3 study [22], the European product labelling specifies an ablation activity of 3.7 GBq 131 I and low-risk status for the patient. Lately, a nearly 400-patient retrospective analysis from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center [65], which also used large activities but included a higher-risk study population than did the pivotal trial, found that, with a median 2.5 years of follow-up, rhTSH-and THW-aided ablation were associated with statistically similarly low rates of clinical recurrence or persistent thyroid bed scintigraphic uptake, as well as statistically similar time to recurrence. This study also found statistically similarly high ablation success rates for the two preparation modalities at 12-18 months.\\nA recent prospective, randomised, controlled investigation [23] suggests that rhTSH-aided ablation with 1.85 GBq of 131 I may achieve a statistically non-inferior ablation success rate to that seen with rhTSH-aided ablation using 3.7 GBq, even in the presence of node metastases. Two prospective studies [66,67], but not another [68], suggest equivalent ablation success rates with rhTSH-versus THWaided ablation using 1.11 GBq. In the two positive trials, thyroid hormone was withheld for a few days before and after radioiodine administration [63,64]. Further studies are desirable to increase the total number of patients and the duration of follow-up that have been reported for rhTSHaided ablation, as well as the published experience with this modality using low ablation activities.\\nrhTSH has also been given \"off-label\" to aid RAIT of locally advanced or metastatic DTC or both in several hundred patients, predominantly adults and predominantly for palliative purposes, with some evident benefit of the rhTSH-aided treatment reported in retrospective series or anecdotally [69][70][71]. In a relatively large, retrospective multicenter series (N=90), rhTSH use appeared to be safe and effective in promoting Tg production, radioiodine uptake or both in patients ≤18 years old (Luster et al., personal communication, 25 June 2008).\\nThe approved regimen of rhTSH is two consecutive daily intramuscular injections of 0.9 mg. Subcutaneous injection was successfully used in a small case series (N=5) of patients on oral anticoagulants and hence at risk of injection site haematoma [72]. Radioiodine is given 1 day and serum Tg testing is performed 3 or 4 days after the second rhTSH injection. When dxWBS is performed, it takes place 48-72 h after the radioiodine is applied; rxWBS is performed 2-7 days following radioiodine administration. rhTSH is typically well-tolerated with short-lived and generally mild nausea (approximately 10% incidence), headache (approximately 7% incidence) and asthaenia (approximately 3% incidence), the most common side effects.\\nIn addition, very likely because of improved renal function and, as a consequence, more rapid excretion of peripheral 131 I under euthyroid versus hypothyroid con-ditions, rhTSH appears to decrease radiation exposure of extra-thyroidal tissues and blood after RAIT [73,74]. This decreased exposure potentially may reduce length of stay under radioprotection conditions [75], the long-term risk of second primary malignancies, or both. rhTSH administration also provides more rapid and predictable TSH elevation than does THW.\\nFor now, unless economically unfeasible, the use of rhTSH is generally the preferred TSH stimulation method before radioiodine ablation with medium-large activities (e.g. 1.85-3.7 GBq) of radioiodine. For ablation with smaller activities, either preparation method may be used.\\nThe rationales for rhTSH use with higher activities are the statistically non-inferior, high ablation success rates [22,65], the similarly low short-term relapse rate [65], the significantly decreased morbidity and the significantly improved QOL [22] of rhTSH preparation relative to THW stimulation that have been documented in two large well-conducted studies. The rationale for rhTSH use with medium activities is a prospective, randomised study showing non-inferior ablation success of 1.85 GBq versus 3.7 GBq under rhTSH stimulation [23].\\nIn the absence to date of prospective studies demonstrating definitive clinical efficacy for rhTSH as an aid to curative RAIT of metastases, THW remains the preferred TSH stimulation method for treatment with a curative intent of metastatic disease. However, rhTSH is recommended in curative RAIT in patients who are unable to tolerate hypothyroidism, for example because of significant co-morbidities, or who are unable to raise endogenous TSH [69,70]. For now, unless economically unfeasible, given the desirability of avoiding hypothyroid morbidity in this setting, the use of rhTSH is also the generally preferred stimulation method before radioiodine treatment of DTC lesions that has a solely palliative intent. If completion thyroidectomy is technically impossible or undesired in patients with large thyroid remnants, e.g. 5-10 ml, endogenous TSH levels <30 mU/L are acceptable before RAIT, but additional exogenous stimulation with rhTSH is a potentially useful, but as yet unproven means to increase the effectiveness of ablative RAIT.\\nClinical caution and steroid co-administration are advised when using THW or rhTSH in patients with known or suspected tumour in confined anatomical spaces, especially in the central nervous system, lungs or bones. Such patients are susceptible to morbid complications of inflammatory tumour expansion or tumour growth under TSH elevation. Absolute and relative contraindications for glucocorticoids, such as diabetes mellitus, ulcus ventriculi or duodeni or electrolyte disorders must be taken into account when considering use of steroids.\\nTo avoid competitive handling by NIS of non-radioactive iodine rather than radioiodine, with a resultant diminution in efficacy of RAIT, patients should be advised to avoid iodine-containing medications, e.g. iodinated contrast agents, antiseptics, eye drops or amiodarone, and iodinecontaining foods, e.g. iodinated multivitamins or mineral supplements or seafood, for 4-6 weeks prior to RAIT. A low-iodine diet, when possible, <50 μg/day, starting 1-2 weeks prior to radioiodine administration is recommended optionally [76,77]. A detailed discussion of low-iodine diets may be found in recent Dutch thyroid cancer management guidelines (http://www.oncoline.nl/index. php?pagina=/richtlijn/item/pagina.php&richtlijn_id=554). Written instructions may be helpful in promoting patient adherence to iodine avoidance measures.\\nBefore every RAIT, patients should be specifically questioned about ingestion of common iodine-containing medications or foods to rule out iodine excess. Urinary stable iodine excretion should be measured preferably routinely, but at a minimum, in doubtful cases. Urinary stable iodine excretion above an arbitrary institutional cut-off in the range of 150-200 μg/L is believed to reflect clinically relevant iodine excess and should lead to postponement of RAIT. After administration of lipophilic iodinated contrast agent (today rarely used) or after amiodarone medication, RAIT should be postponed for at least 3 months, and in other cases of iodine excess, RAIT should be postponed for 4-6 weeks.\\nThe literature contains mixed findings as to whether the continued thyroid hormone ingestion permitted by rhTSH use leads to clinically relevant elevated iodine levels [22,66]. Some clinicians favour a \"mini-withdrawal\" of thyroid hormone for a short period (e.g. 2 days each) before and after RAIT [67]. However, there is as yet no published evidence that \"mini-withdrawal\" improves ablation outcome.\\nAbundant food intake may alter the resorption of orally administered radioiodine. Patients should fast or at a minimum, refrain from large meals 4 h prior to and 1 h after radioiodine administration.\\nPhysicians should ensure that national regulations for radioiodine administration, including those regarding radiation protection, are carefully observed. Special care should be exercised to ensure that patients living with young children are properly informed of radiation protection measures. During hospitalisation, residual whole-body 131 I activity should be quantified by measurement using, e.g. a gamma probe, at least upon discharge and preferably daily.\\nTo ensure that it is appropriate to perform RAIT and to optimise the preparation method, 131 I activity and other aspects of the procedure, the following information should be obtained and the following examinations should be conducted before each radioiodine ablation or treatment: \\n&\\nTo optimise the safety and efficacy and minimise the negative impact of each RAIT, the following precautions should be observed:\\nAvoidance of \"stunning\": Stunning is defined as diminution of RAIT uptake and efficacy due to suboptimal therapeutic effects, biological effects, or both, of prior diagnostic radioiodine administration. In cases where RAIT clearly will be necessary, pre-therapeutic 131 I dxWBS or thyroid bed uptake measurement should be avoided because their results will not modify the indication for RAIT and these procedures may induce stunning. To reduce the possibility of stunning when it is not yet known whether RAIT is indicated, thyroid bed uptake quantification or 131 I dxWBS performed before the potential RAIT should employ low radioiodine activities. Recommended quantities are approximately 3-10 MBq for uptake quantification and 10-185 MBq for WBS. Alternatively, use of 40-200 MBq of 123-iodine ( 123 I) for diagnostic imaging minimises the risk of stunning. However, the lower imaging sensitivity and higher cost of 123 I compared with 131 I are disadvantageous. 123 I WBS should employ a gamma camera with a large field of view and a medium-energy, high-resolution collimator. Thyroid scintigraphy with 99m -technetium can give very useful information without the need for 123 I. 124-iodine ( 124 I) PET/CT is emerging as an attractive experimental modality in expert hands for pre-RAIT imaging and dosimetry [43,78,79]. The extent of stunning effects with 124 I is as yet unknown, but as a precaution, activities of this radioisotope should be kept to a minimum.\\nMinimisation of physiological radioiodine uptake and retention: In the 24 h following radioiodine administration, liberal oral hydration and use of lemon juice or sour candy or chewing gum increases salivary flow and reduces radiation exposure of the salivary glands [80,81]. It is not evident whether lemon juice may be even more effective 24 h after than immediately after radioiodine administration [80].\\nAdjuvant medication with a mild laxative increases the colonic emptying rate, decreasing radiation exposure of the intestines and facilitating scan interpretation. This measure is especially important in cases of constipation. The stomach lining should be protected by liberal oral hydration, and use of medication, e.g. H2-blockers, also may be helpful. Liberal oral hydration and frequent urination may minimise radiation exposure of the urinary bladder and the gonads.\\nManagement of and prophylaxis against neck compression symptoms: Ice packs should be applied and non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory medication should be administered if inflammatory reaction occurs in the lower neck. In cases of radioiodine ablation of larger thyroid remnants, glucocorticoids may be optionally given for some days as prophylaxis.\\nPregnancy, breastfeeding and conception: Pregnancy must be excluded by a beta-hCG-based test within a few days before each RAIT. Adjunctive use of US to rule out pregnancy may also be considered. Routine urinary pregnancy tests might miss a late (midterm) pregnancy due to both a decreased production of beta-hCG and a decreased degree of sialinisation, which results in a shorter half-life of beta-hCG due to metabolisation in the liver [82,83]. Patients should be advised to discontinue breastfeeding for 6-8 weeks before radioiodine administration. Conception should be avoided by means of effective contraception for 6 months after RAIT, an interval that allows the replacement of irradiated by non-irradiated spermatozoa and decreases risk of fetal abnormalities [83]. Avoidance of conception for 12 months has been shown to mitigate increased risk of miscarriage [84]. If RAIT is expected to involve high cumulative 131 I activities, e.g. ≥14 GBq, pre-RAIT sperm banking is recommended in men whose family planning is not yet completed [85]. Additionally, female patients should be advised that a modestly earlier onset of menopause has been reported after repeated courses of RAIT [84].\\nWhilst RAIT is generally well-tolerated if appropriate single and cumulative activities are used and precautions employed, the procedure does have a number of potential early and late sequelae. These sequelae and potential prophylactic and treatment interventions are described in Table 1. Characterisation of the risks of RAIT remains ongoing; for example, an overview of the radiation absorbed dose to normal organs after RAIT was published recently [86].\\nBesides surgery [87], treatments that may be used instead of or in addition to RAIT include cytotoxic chemotherapy, external beam radiotherapy (XRT), local interventions and so-called molecularly targeted therapies. The main settings for these treatments are late-stage, progressive DTC or symptomatic or progressive lesions that are unresectable and that have failed to respond to RAIT or are unlikely to do so.\\nCytotoxic chemotherapy has no role in the routine management of DTC but rather should be restricted, preferably within controlled clinical trials, to symptomatic, progressive, end-stage disease uncontrolled by RAIT, surgery or XRT. Among chemotherapies studied to date, doxorubicin monotherapy still provides the best clinical results, even compared with combination regimens, but attains partial response rates of at most 10-20% and very rare durable responses [88,89]. A recent small study [90] showed a 37% response rate (5/16) in patients with nonfunctioning lung metastases given the combination of carboplatin plus epirubicin under TSH stimulation (endogenous or rhTSH). The TSH elevation was applied to foster tumour cell division and, hence, vulnerability to chemotherapy; this strategy merits further study, though molecularly targeted therapies may be a more promising line of investigation.\\nThe role of XRT of primary tumours, cervical metastases or both is still controversial: evidence is available only from retrospective reviews with sometimes poorly defined inclusion criteria, inconsistent treatment regimens or obsolete standards of radiotherapy [93]. Traditional indications for XRT in the DTC setting have been unresectable gross disease, gross tumours left behind after operation, gross evidence of local invasion or as post-operative adjuvant therapy.\\nWhen neck lesions accumulate 131 I, it may be useful to give RAIT and XRT in combination, since radioiodine may stop the tumour cells in phases (G2, M) in which the cells are especially sensitive to XRT [94]. Patients with tracheal invasion by DTC have a high local recurrence rate if they have undergone a \"shave\" excision of the tracheal cartilage; if \"en bloc surgery\" is not feasible, XRT is advocated in such patients even when only microscopic disease remains [95].\\nIn addition, XRT should be considered in the management of painful bone metastases or of metastases in critical locations likely to result in fractures or neurological or compressive symptoms, if these lesions are not amenable to surgery [91,[96][97][98]. Use of RAIT in combination with XRT may increase the response, especially in painful bone lesions [98].\\nOne strategy for formulating XRT regimens is to take a similar approach to that used with other head and neck carcinomas. According to this strategy, total delivered absorbed doses should be 65-70 Gy to gross disease left behind, 60 Gy to adjacent target volume with risk of microscopic dissemination and 50 Gy to microscopic disease in a pre-operative setting. For DTC, a 2 Gy/fraction administered 5 days/week is most often used, but fractionation regimens have not been systematically evaluated. Another strategy for XRT regimen formulation is to choose the highest doses that are reasonably well-tolerated [92].\\nWhen possible, XRT of the neck should employ the three-dimensional conformational or intensity-modulated radiation therapy techniques, which provide better balance between anti-tumour efficacy and safety of normal adjoining structures than do traditional delivery methods [93]. Appropriate precautions should be taken to prevent radiation myelopathy. If possible, salivary glands on the least affected side should be excluded from the radiation target volume to prevent xerostomy.\\nXRT of distant metastases should follow similar practices to those employed with XRT of the neck, but with special consideration of the frequently slow progress of metastatic disease. A long expected survival together with a good performance status speak in favour of a lower fractionation dose (Gy/fraction) to potentially reduce late toxicity and in favour of a higher total absorbed dose to improve local control.\\nLocal interventions to ameliorate symptoms or slow tumour progression include chemoembolisation, radiofrequency ablation or cement injection and, as a systemic therapy, bisphosphonate medication [10].\\nWith improved understanding of the genetic and molecular bases of DTC, molecularly targeted therapies for the malignancy have emerged, particularly in the past decade, as the focus of considerable pre-clinical and clinical research. Present molecularly targeted therapies can mostly be classified as (1) cell signalling or angiogenesis inhibitors or as (2) inducers of tumour cell re-differentiation and, hence, potentially, radioiodine uptake, retention or both [10].\\nA variety of compounds targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, RET tyrosine kinase, BRAF kinase or membrane receptor kinases are currently in phase II clinical trials, have had preliminary results reported or both (reviewed in [10]). The preliminary results have included disease stabilisation or response. Some of the molecular targets of these compounds occur more frequently or exclusively in certain DTC histotypes, e.g. somatostatin receptor type 2 in Hürthle cell carcinoma; few, if any, of the targets are expressed in all DTC tumours [10,100]. Hence, the future use of cell signalling agents or angiogenesis inhibitors is likely to entail pre-therapeutic pharmacogenomic testing to select patients in whom a given medication or combination of medications is likely to be efficacious.\\nThe most widely investigated re-differentiation therapies have been the vitamin A analogues, the retinoids [10, 100-105], which by binding to their receptors, increase NIS expression and radioiodine uptake in tumour cells [103,104]. However, de-differentiated DTC cells have numerous metabolic defects other than deficient NIS expression, and these defects may, for example, impair radioiodine retention, decreasing the tumour dose and RAIT efficacy [10]. This phenomenon may partially account for the relatively low response rates-20% to 30%-to retinoid re-differentiation therapy in clinical trials to date [10,100]. Another explanation for the low response rates may be that studies till now have not screened patients for retinoid receptor expression; use of such screening might increase response rates even as it narrows the treated population [10,100]. Of interest, a recent case report suggests that retinoids may exert therapeutic biological effects independent of enhancing RAIT [107].\\nBefore receiving RAIT, patients should be informed about: & additional or alternative therapeutic and management options, as appropriate, including \"watchful waiting\", & potential benefits of RAIT, & potential adverse effects and risks of RAIT (Table 1), & advantages and disadvantages of THW and rhTSH and regulatory status of the latter, & the need and methods to avoid iodine excess, & the need for hospitalisation during RAIT, & radiation protection recommendations during hospitalisation and after discharge, & the need to avoid pregnancy and breastfeeding and the need for both female and male patients to use effective contraception for 6-12 months after RAIT, & the need for lifelong, risk-adapted follow-up care for DTC patients and the importance of adherence to suppressive doses of LT4 in cases where such doses are indicated, & local, regional and national support groups and other resources for DTC patients and their families.\\nIt can be helpful to reiterate the above information in written handouts that patients and families can refer to at home. Clinicians should document the pre-RAIT counselling and should obtain written informed consent as required by institutional, regional or national regulations.\\nBecause of its high sensitivity for localising and characterising the extent of thyroid remnant and tumour and detecting previously occult lesions, whole-body gamma scintigraphy with spot imaging of regions of interest (ROIs) as applicable, should be performed following every RAIT. rxWBS should not take place sooner than 72 h after radioiodine administration during THW or sooner than 72 h after the second injection of rhTSH. Appendix 2 presents additional considerations for rxWBS.\\nWhenever available, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or, preferably, SPECT/CT of the neck and other anatomical regions as appropriate and feasible, should be performed at the time of rxWBS. By providing a three-dimensional image of involved lymph nodes, SPECT is an excellent means of visualising DTC lymph node lesions, and SPECT/CT adds morphological information to the functional data furnished by SPECT alone [ b In these patients, the indication for XRT and the urgency of RAIT should be considered in the decision on whether to give RAIT. Appendix 1. Pre-therapeutic dosimetry concepts for radioiodine therapy Pre-therapeutic dosimetry for RAIT may take either or both of two forms: (1) remnant-and lesion-based dosimetry and (2) bone marrow (blood) dosimetry.\\nA. Remnant-and lesion-based dosimetry\\nThe objective of remnant or lesion dosimetry, sometimes referred to as the \"Maxon approach\" in honour of one of its key developers, is to determine the individualised radioiodine activity that delivers the recommended doses of radiation to ablate thyroid remnant or to treat metastatic disease whilst minimising the risk to the patient. These absorbed doses are traditionally considered to be ≥300 Gy to ablate thyroid remnant and ≥80 Gy to successfully treat metastatic disease [115]. Individualising the RAIT activity may help avoid over-or under-treating the remnant, tumour or both, which is presumed to have efficacy or safety benefits, or both.\\nTo perform these calculations, it is necessary to measure the uptake and clearance of the 131 I from identifiable thyroid remnants, DTC metastases or both. To determine the 131 I concentration, one needs to know how much activity is contained in the lesion. One way to determine this is through an analysis of selected ROIs on conjugate view gamma camera images or on SPECT images [116].\\nThese images are obtained at several time points following the administration of a tracer activity. Typically, these images would be acquired up to 96 h after tracer administration, but later time samples might be necessary if the uptake and clearance are delayed. In addition, transmission images, scatter images or both might be necessary to correct for attenuation or scatter or in the region of the lesion. Images of a standard for calibration purposes might also be needed [116]. A curve-fitting procedure then is used to determine the assumed single-exponential half-life value and to extrapolate the curve to time zero to determine the initial activity in the lesion.\\nPre-therapeutic dosimetric assessments of the activity required to achieve a certain prescribed absorbed dose to a remnant or lesion are often based on adaptations of the generic MIRD equation for absorbed dose [117]:\\nD ¼ Ã Â S Â m r m t\\nwhere D denotes the mean absorbed dose to the remnant/ lesion, Ã, the cumulative activity (the integral of the activity-time curve), m r , the reference mass of the thyroid (20.7 g), and m t is the remnant/lesion mass. S is the MIRDdefined S value for thyroid self-irradiation (5.652×10 -3 Gy MBq -1 h -1 , see MIRD Pamphlet 11 [117] or, for example, the guidelines of the German Society of Nuclear Medicine [118]).\\nThe lesion mass is another variable needed in order to calculate the activity concentration delivering the required absorbed dose. For ablation therapies, remnant volumetry methods such as US or CT are unreliable, as it is impossible to differentiate thyroid tissue from haematoma on these modalities. Thus no thoroughly validated method yet exists to exactly determine the mass of thyroid remnants after surgery [73]. For this reason, one must be careful when reporting absorbed doses to the target tissue. For lesion dosimetry, higher spatial resolution images, such as those obtained with CT or US, can be used for attenuation correction and to determine the mass.\\nIf the lesions are small, the nodule module of the OLINDA/EXM software might be useful to generate a spherical model of the remnant, tumour or both [119]. Furthermore, if the dimensions of the lesions are smaller than approximately 5 mm-assuming that this could be accurately determined-then the range of the beta particles can no longer be neglected in the dose calculation [120].\\nThe use of 124 I was proposed for quantifying in vivo tumour radioiodine concentration and biodistribution in DTC patients [78,79,121,122]. Due to the complex decay process of 124 I, the quantification process cannot be performed in the same way as for the pure positron emitter FDG. Pentlow et al. [78] measured resolution, linearity and the ability to quantify the activity contents of imaged spheres of different sizes and activities in different background activities. It was shown that the 124 I quantification could reproduce the activities administered. 124 I PET was also successfully applied to the measurement of thyroid volume [121, 122]. Today\\'s state-of-the-art 124 I PET-based DTC dosimetry protocol has been described in recent publications by Sgouros et al. [79]. Using the PET results as input to a fully three-dimensional dose planning programme, those investigators calculated spatial distributions of absorbed doses, isodose contours, dose-volume histograms and mean absorbed dose estimates for a total of 56 tumours. The mean tumour absorbed dose for each patient ranged widely, from 1.2 to 540 Gy. The absorbed dose distribution for individual tumour voxels was even more widely distributed, ranging from 0.3 to 4,000 Gy.\\nFindings similar to those of the Sgorous and coworkers study, of median per-patient tumour radiation absorbed doses between 1.3 and 368 Gy, were recently reported by de Keizer et al. [71] who performed tumour dosimetry after rhTSHstimulated 131 I treatment. Dosimetric calculations were performed using tumour radioiodine uptake measurements from post-treatment 131 I scintigrams and tumour volume estimations were generated from radiological images.\\nThe main disadvantages of a lesion-based approach to RAIT dosimetry in DTC are: & Absorbed lesion doses range widely even within a single patient.\\n& Contrary to assumptions inherent in dosimetry protocols, absorbed dose distributions vary within lesions, which could result in incomplete tumour destruction. & A mono-exponential model may not accurately reflect lesional radioiodine kinetics. & Unclearly defined correction factors must be applied for the initial phase of increasing uptake (up to approximately 24 h post-radioiodine administration). & An accurate estimate of the lesion mass is not always possible, e.g. with disseminated iodine-avid lung metastases or irregularly shaped lesions. & Low uptake in lesions and, therefore, low count rates may cause statistical errors in the measurements. & The biological effectiveness of dosimetry-guided RAIT is not proven yet. & Doses may be systematically underestimated for lesions <5 mm in diameter if no corrections are applied.\\nIn addition, currently, when 131 I is used, relatively high diagnostic activities, i.e. at least 37 MBq, are necessary for quantitative imaging of the target thyroid tissue for dosimetry; these activities have the potential to induce \"stunning\" (see the \"Precautions\" section above), which is a particularly critical consideration in radioiodine treatment of metastatic disease [123].\\nThe method originally reported by Benua et al. [42] and Leeper [124] allows the estimation of the radiation dose that will be delivered to the haematopoietic system from each GBq administered to any patient. The method involves measurement of radiation counts of serial blood samples and serial calibrated probe measurements of the patient\\'s whole-body activity over the course of 4 or more days after 131 I tracer administration. The original Benua et al. study [42] determined that the subgroup of patients who received ≤2 Gy to the blood avoided serious myelosuppression; this dose has become the principal traditionally accepted safety threshold for RAIT. In addition, the whole-body retention at 48 h after radioiodine administration should not exceed 4.44 GBq (120 mCi) in the absence of iodine-avid diffuse lung metastases or 2.96 GBq (80 mCi) in the presence of such lesions [39].\\nIn the classic Benua approach, the blood is considered the critical organ that is irradiated either by the particles emitted from activity in the blood itself or by the emissions originating from activity dispersed throughout the remainder of the body. Recently, in the framework of international multi-centre studies of radioiodine biokinetics after rhTSH administration [125], the absorbed dose to the blood was calculated with a modified method derived from a procedure originally described by Thomas et al. [126]. Refinements to this model have been introduced to account for: & the contribution to the blood dose of penetrating radiation from activity in distant blood, & the mass dependency of the S value representing the radiation from the total body to the blood, & a mean value, S blood blood , representing an average for blood circulating in vessels of varying diameters and s values [44].\\nThe recent studies show that the results of pre-therapeutic blood-based dosimetry agree well with measured posttherapeutic absorbed doses. Therefore, the pre-therapeutic data can reliably project therapeutic absorbed doses to blood.\\nFor blood-based dosimetry, only two compartments need be monitored for radioactivity: the blood and the gamma ray absorbed doses to the whole body. The activity in the blood is determined by measuring periodic heparinised blood samples. The activity in the whole body, i.e. remaining in the patient, can be monitored redundantly using independent techniques: 24-h urine collections, whole-body counting with a probe using a fixed geometry and, if applicable, conjugate views of a WBS obtained with a dual-headed gamma camera.\\nDetails regarding the sampling times, measurements and calculations can be found in the EANM Dosimetry Committee Series on Standard Operational Procedures for Pre-Therapeutic Dosimetry (I. Blood and Bone Marrow Dosimetry in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Therapy) [44].\\nThe recommended equation for the absorbed dose to the blood per unit of administered activity [44] is:\\nD blood A 0 Gy GBq ¼ 108 Â t ml of blood h ½ þ 0:0188 wt kg ½ ð\\nÞ 2=nlldelimiterspace3 Â t total body h ½ τ total body [h] and τ ml of blood [h] stand for the residence time in a source organ, representing the integral of the time-activity curve in that organ (cumulative activity) divided by the administered activity A 0 ; wt represents the patient\\'s weight. In addition, the EANM Dosimetry Committee guidelines give a formula for the assessment of the absorbed dose to the bone marrow [44].\\nThe tracer activity necessary for a reliable assessment of the whole-body residence time depends on the equipment used (see Section 3.3 in [44]). The potential risk of the diagnostic absorbed dose dramatically changing the iodine kinetics in target tissue limits the administered activity to amounts much lower than 74 MBq 131 I [123]. Under all circumstances, one should avoid administering activities which lead to total absorbed doses to iodine-avid tissue of >5 Gy [127].\\nAn activity of 10-15 MBq of131 I should suffice for a pre-therapeutic blood-based dosimetry assessment. Based on experience to date, this range of activities will provide sufficient count statistics whilst most probably not causing any changes between pre-and post-therapeutic biokinetics of 131 I.\\nThe strengths of the blood-based approach are:\\n& determination of the maximal safe activity of radioiodine for each RAIT in each individual, & identification of patients for whom empiric fixed activities are not safe [128], & the potential to administer higher activities once instead of lower activities multiple times in a \"fractionated\" therapy to avoid changes in lesion biokinetics after multiple therapies that have been observed, e.g. by Samuel et al. [129], & a long history of use in several institutions, & an expected increase in the probability of curing patients in advanced stage of the disease with fewer courses of therapy.\\nLimitations that need to be mentioned are:\\n& a benefit of the strategy is plausible, but no valid clinical data yet exist on improved response or outcome rates; & the absorbed dose to the tumour is not known: higher activities might be administered without achieving a better therapeutic effect when using this methodology; & the current debate regarding the issue of \"stunning\" argues that diagnostic administrations of 131 I could alter lesion biokinetics and, consequently, the absorbed dose in a subsequent RAIT; & increased cost and inconvenience, although this may be outweighed by rendering further treatments unnecessary.\\nPatient-specific blood-based dosimetry is easy to perform both pre-therapeutically and peri-therapeutically and allows the RAIT activity for selected patients to be increased without risk of severe side effects. In addition, simplified protocols have not been tested yet.\\nC. Interpretation and quantification rxWBS images should be interpreted visually for location of functional tissue. The quantification of radioiodine uptake in functioning tissue by a ROI technique and by comparison with a calibrated 131 I activity can be helpful for post-therapeutic dosimetry and for follow-up data.\\nThe report should include the location, size and intensity of any areas of uptake that correspond to any functioning tissue. Description of comparisons with prior images is useful. The results of Tg assays and TSH are helpful for the interpretation of the scintigraphic findings. & local contamination (clothing, skin, hair, collimator, crystal), & oesophageal activity, & asymmetrical salivary gland uptake, & non-specific uptake, e.g. in pulmonary infections, oedema, the breast, kidney cysts and the thymus.\\nTo avoid artefacts caused by cutaneous contamination with radioiodine, the patient should shower and change underwear before rxWBS.\\nAcknowledgments The authors thank Professor Furio Pacini of the University of Siena and Robert J.

Purpose of rxWBS Detection and localisation or exclusion of one or more of functioning thyroid remnants, persistent or recurrent local disease or metastases in patients with DTC.\\n\\nTailored dosimetry in the radioiodine treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer\\nThis thesis describes different aspects of tailored dosimetry in the radioiodine treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). This involves the use of different radionuclides of iodine for diagnosis and for therapy. First, 124 I is used in the detection and characterization of thyroid remnants and iodine-avid lesions, followed by accurate lesion absorbed dose assessment. In a pre-therapeutic setting, this can provide relevant information on treatment outcome and can be used in the optimization of the therapeutic 131 I activity dosage. Second, medical imaging and treatment using radionuclides should be performed with acceptable radiation exposure to the patient, personnel, general population and environment. These are in a nutshell the topics that will be covered in the various chapters of this thesis.\\nThyroid carcinoma is a relatively rare type of cancer. With a yearly incidence of 3.1 and 9.3 per 100,000 for men and females respectively, thyroid cancer accounted for less than 2% of all newly diagnosed cancers in Europe in 2012 [1]. However, thyroid cancer is the most frequent endocrine malignancy and during the last three decades the yearly incidence has shown a significant increase worldwide [2]. A large fraction of this rising incidence consisted of small volume tumour [3]. Improved detection of these subclinical tumours due to increased diagnostic scrutiny and advances in technology has been ascribed to contribute to the increase in thyroid cancer incidence [4,5]. Of all thyroid cancers, the vast majority (>90%) comprises differentiated thyroid carcinomas that derive from the follicular epithelium, including papillary and follicular cancer [6].\\nIn DTC pathology basic biologic characteristics of healthy thyroid tissue, including specific iodine uptake through the sodium iodide symporter, are retained. Given appropriate treatment including radioiodine therapy, the prognosis of DTC is in general excellent, and 10-year relative survival rates 1 of 0.98 for papillary and 0.92 for follicular disease have been reported [7]. However, in patients presenting distant metastases, substantially lower survival rates in the range of 0.25 -0.40 have been described [8,9]. Furthermore, as a result of the relatively high recurrence rate up to 0.10 -0.30, lifelong follow-up is recommended and subsequent therapy is needed in a substantial number of patients [10]. The application of personalized radioiodine treatment using accurate patient specific dosimetry calculations based on advanced pre-therapeutic molecular imaging techniques such as 124 I PET/CT or PET/MRI may further improve patient treatment and outcome.\\nIodine is a chemical element belonging to the halogen group. The elemental form of iodine was discovered in 1811 by the French chemist Bernard Courtois. Based on its purple-violet colour, the element was named after the Greek word ιωδης meaning \"violet\". 127 I is the only stable isotope of iodine having a natural abundance of 100%. In 1934 Enrico Fermi produced the first radioisotope of iodine by neutron bombardment: 128 I. EC: electron capture, ce: conversion electron, T½ : half-life, K : characteristic X-ray photon emitted by electron transition to K shell from L (α) or higher shells (β). † Beta particle end-point-energy.\\nThe potential of using radioactive iodine for both measurement of thyroid function and therapy of thyroid cancer was quickly recognized and the first patients were treated with 131 I in the early 1940s [11]. With the development of the first gamma camera by Anger in 1952 [12], radioiodine became the first theranostic (radio)pharmaceutical.\\nThe radioisotopes of iodine used in medical diagnosis and therapy of thyroid disease are mostly limited to 123  I single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) [13]. In addition, 124 I PET has the best spatial resolution followed by 123 I SPECT and131 I SPECT. In Figure 1.2 an overview of the spatial resolution for all iodine radioisotopes and corresponding imaging technique is shown [13].\\nFIGURE 1.2. Comparison of the full-width at half and tenth of maximum (FWHM and FWTM) spatial resolution between 123 I SPECT, 124 I PET and 131 I SPECT, according to Rault et al. [13]. The spatial resolution of 123 I is shown for two different types of SPECT collimators: low energy high resolution (LEHR) and medium energy (ME). For I for pre-ablation imaging has been reported to reduce iodine uptake and residence time in the subsequent ablation therapy and can thereby decrease the effectiveness of the ablation, an effect known as stunning [15]. To minimize possible stunning effects, it is recommended to limit the pretherapeutically delivered absorbed dose to thyroid remnants [16].\\nAlthough a personalized approach is required by the European union council directive 2013 [17], in clinical practise, empirically determined fixed amounts of 131 I activity are generally administered in radioiodine treatment based on disease characteristics and patient age, with the risk of under-or overdosing [10,18,19]. Radioiodine treatment in DTC has been shown to result in adverse effects such as salivary gland dysfunction, transient gonadal dysfunction and second primary malignancies. The prevalence and severity of these effects have been shown to correlate with increasing 131 I dose [20]. Since several studies reported no statistically significant differences in success rate between low-dose (1.1 -1.85 GBq) and high-dose (3.7 -5.5 GBq) 131 I radioiodine therapy in low-to intermediate-risk patients2 [21][22][23][24], low-dose radioiodine therapy may be feasible and could result in a decrease of adverse effects. In contrast, for patients presenting with distant metastases radioiodine therapy success is decreased and multiple high-dose (3.7 -7.4 GBq) radioiodine treatments are often required [10]. As Kulkarni et al. demonstrated that in more than 90% of such patients even much higher doses can be administered, they concluded that the majority of high-risk patients are potentially undertreated using a fixed radioiodine activity approach [25].\\nAs an alternative to empirically determined fixed 131 I activity approaches, pretherapeutic dosimetry can be used to facilitate personalized radioiodine treatment. To this purpose, two main approaches have been developed: 1) maximum-tolerated radioiodine activity administration and 2) lesion-based dosimetry. In the maximum-tolerated activity approach, the therapeutic amount of radioiodine is calculated to restrict either the absorbed dose to the blood to 2 Gy (a limit which is widely accepted for red bone marrow toxicity) or the 48 hour post-administration whole-body retention to 4.4 GBq in the absence of diffuse lung metastases [10]. The European association of nuclear medicine dosimetry committee has published a standard operational procedure guideline on blood absorbed dose assessment in differentiated thyroid cancer therapy [26]. In the lesion-based dosimetry approach, the amount of therapeutic radioiodine activity is optimized to ensure a lesion absorbed dose above established threshold values reported to yield high therapeutic response, whilst minimising the risk to the patient. The generally accepted absorbed dose threshold values are 300 Gy for thyroid remnants and 85 Gy for lymph node metastases [27,28]. Despite the fact that the biological effectiveness of dosimetry guided approaches is not proven yet [10] and, consequently, personalized radioiodine treatment is not globally adopted, the use of pre-therapeutic lesion absorbed dose assessment based on 124 I positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging has been reported to change patient management in 25%-50% of DTC patients [29,30].\\nHybrid PET/CT and PET/MRI PET is a three-dimensional (3D) non-invasive nuclear imaging technique that uses the unique decay characteristics of radionuclides that disintegrate via β + -decay [31]. These radionuclides can be labelled to chemical compounds of biological interest, so-called radiopharmaceuticals. Depending on the (patho)physiological process of interest, a specific radiopharmaceutical is administered to a patient. In the patient\\'s body, β +decay takes place during which a positron is emitted. This positron combines with a nearby electron followed by an annihilation process in which two so-called annihilation photons are emitted in opposite directions. Using coincidence detection, the annihilation process can be localized somewhere along the straight line joining the two locations of the photon detection. Using advanced reconstruction algorithms, quantitative 3D images of the radiopharmaceutical distribution in the patient\\'s body can be obtained.\\nSince the introduction of hybrid PET/CT systems in 2001 [32], the integration of PET and CT in one single device has been shown to provide important additional information compared to stand-alone PET and CT or PET/CT carried out using two stand-alone (nonhybrid) systems in combination with software-based co-registration [33,34]. Apart from improved anatomical localization of PET findings on morphological CT images and improvement of PET attenuation correction, the combination of contrast-enhanced, full diagnostic CT images with PET has been demonstrated to change patient management in specific clinical conditions [35]. In fact, within a decade after the introduction of hybrid PET/CT systems, stand-alone clinical PET devices were no longer commercially available.\\nIn spite of the success of hybrid PET/CT systems, the technique has certain limitations and shortcomings. As full integration of PET and CT, allowing simultaneous acquisi-tion of both modalities, is inherently difficult, PET and CT scans are acquired sequentially which can result in problematic artefacts or spatial registration errors resulting from intra-and inter-scan patient or organ motion [36]. Moreover, hybrid PET/CT examinations result in an increased patient radiation burden compared to stand-alone PET, in particular when full diagnostic CT imaging is performed [37]. Due to the superior softtissue contrast of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared to CT and large variety of MR acquisition sequences resulting in various organ and tissue representations, there are numerous clinical indications where MRI is preferred over CT.\\nAlthough the idea of a combined PET/MRI system was already suggested and patented in 1990 [38], human PET/MRI systems capable of simultaneous whole body PET and MRI acquisitions became only commercially available from 2010 [39]. The most important reasons for this delay are the technical challenges encountered in the integration of PET and MRI into a single hybrid system, the initial lack of industrial interest and concerns about the price of hybrid PET/MRI systems [40]. The main technical challenges originate from the mutual interference of the two imaging modalities, the requirement of using compact MRI-compatible PET detectors to be integrated inside the main MRI magnet and the development of MRI-based PET attenuation correction methods [41].\\nAs the performance of photomultiplier tubes is severely degraded by even a weak magnetic field, conventional photomultiplier tube-based PET detectors cannot be used in simultaneous PET/MRI systems. Conversely, placement of conventional PET scanner components inside the magnet bore degrades both the static magnetic field homogeneity and the performance of the MRI gradient system causing image artefacts [42]. The development of compact magnetic field insensitive solid-state photo-detectors (such as avalanche photodiodes and silicon photomultipliers) allowed for direct integration of PET detectors inside the bore of an essentially unmodified MRI system with minimal sacrifice in PET or MRI performance [41].\\nQuantitative PET imaging requires accurate corrections for photon attenuation and scatter during PET image reconstruction. Whereas PET/CT allows for a straightforward transformation of CT Hounsfield units (HU) to linear attenuation coefficients at 511 keV, MRI-based PET attenuation and scatter correction is more challenging. At present, the most widely adopted PET attenuation and scatter correction techniques implemented in clinical PET/MRI systems are segmentation-based methods in which MR images are segmented into different tissue types to which fixed pre-defined linear attenuation coefficients are assigned [43]. However, standard whole body MRI segmentation-based methods do not allow for the detection of bone resulting in underestimation of the PET radioactivity concentration in bone up to 22.5% [44]. The development of novel MRbased attenuation correction techniques using bone mask pairs has been shown to improve PET/MRI quantification in bone and these techniques are expected to be clinically implemented in the nearby future [45,46]. Finally, the presence of radiofrequency (RF) MRI coils in the PET field of view can result in significant photon attenuation [47].\\nFor rigid, stationary RF coils, coil attenuation correction using pre-defined CT-based attenuation maps is automatically integrated in the PET image reconstruction algorithm upon detection of the coil. Although for flexible RF surface coils various attenuation correction techniques have been proposed [48,49], in general these coils are optimized for PET-transparency by stripping the coils from as much of its PET attenuation materials as possible. As further improvements in PET/MRI attenuation correction are essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment monitoring, the application of new improved MRI-based attenuation correction techniques are still investigated [43].\\nPre-therapeutic absorbed lesion dose assessment using 124 I PET 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most used PET tracer nowadays. The physical halflife of 110 minutes of 18 F allows for distribution of FDG among nearby PET facilities obviating the need of an on-site cyclotron. In addition, the half-life of 18 F is sufficiently long to study organ and tissue glucose metabolism, often affected in many disease types, whilst maintaining the radiation dose to patients at an acceptable level. Finally, the pure β + -decay (yield: 0.967), low positron energy (0.63 MeV), resulting in a short average positron range in soft-tissue [50], and absence of interfering gamma photons make 18 F the ideal radionuclide for quantitative PET imaging. The last decades, 124 I PET(/CT) has been used to investigate iodine metabolism in a quantitative way. With a half-life of 4.18 days, 124 I is suitable for PET imaging in DTC.\\nHowever, unlike 18 F, 124 I is a far from ideal radionuclide for quantitative PET imaging. Due to its relatively low positron yield of 22.5%, the count rate sensitivity is over 4 times lower compared to 18 F. Moreover, as a result of the high energy of the emitted positrons (2.14 MeV, yield 10.7%; 1.54 MeV, yield 11.7 %), the effective spatial resolution of 124 I is degraded by 0.5-1.0 mm in soft-tissue compared to 18 F [51][52][53]. Furthermore, emitting a cascade of gamma photons as shown in Figure 1. 1,  124 I is not a pure positron emitter. In fact, approximately half of all emitted positrons are directly followed by a socalled prompt gamma photon of 603 keV. Since the cascade gamma photon energy is close to the energy of the 511 keV annihilation photons, it falls within the energy window of current PET systems. This results in detection of both random coincidences, due to detection of one or two cascade gamma photons originating from different disintegration events, and true coincidences of one annihilation photon and a prompt gamma photon from the same disintegration, or even a coincidence caused by two cascading high-energy prompt gamma photons. Whereas the random coincidences are accurately corrected for by standard random correction algorithms such as the delayed window technique, the prompt gamma coincidences are not [54]. In fact, it has been shown that the conventionally applied scatter correction algorithms result in an underestimation of the measured 124 I radioactivity concentration in the central part of the image due to overestimation of the amount of scatter [55]. Despite these challenges, several expert groups have concluded that quantitation of 124 I PET images is feasible [56][57][58][59][60]. Furthermore, compared to 123 I and 131 I SPECT imaging, 124 I PET offers a better image spatial resolution (shown in Figure 1.2) and higher count rate sensitivity. As a result, 124 I PET has been used for the application of pretherapeutic lesion-based dosimetry in radioiodine therapy in DTC [29,30,[61][62][63]. However, to date, the only study addressing the dose-response relationship in radioiodine therapy in DTC by means of pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/CT in a large number of patients was recently published by Jentzen et al. [64]. In order to globally establish pretherapeutic 124 I PET lesion dosimetry as a valuable prognostic tool in personalized radioiodine therapy in DTC, further clinical investigations and improvements in 124 I PET quantification are required.\\nThe term internal dosimetry is often used to describe the science of internal radiation dose assessment. Whereas this term contains the suffix metry, implying that the radiation dose is directly determined from measurements, radiation dose assessment resulting from the administration of radiopharmaceuticals is in fact entirely founded in theoretical calculations and models [65].\\nThe principal quantity used to express the amount of radiation that is received by the tissues of a person\\'s body is the absorbed radiation dose D, defined as the amount of energy from ionizing radiation deposited per unit mass of tissue and expressed in the international system of units (SI) in Gray (1 Gy = 1 J/kg). Although assessment of the absorbed radiation dose can be rather complicated in practice, the medical internal radiation dose (MIRD) system provides a conceptually simple methodology based on both the physical properties of the radionuclide and biologic distribution data. In this methodology the mean absorbed dose D(r k ) to target organ r k resulting from radioactivity accumulated in nearby source organs r h per unit of administered amount of radioactivity A 0 [MBq] is given by [66] 𝐷𝐷(𝑟𝑟 k )/𝐴𝐴 0 = ∑ 𝜏𝜏 h 𝑆𝑆(𝑟𝑟 k ← 𝑟𝑟 h ) ] the absorbed dose to the target organ r k per unit cumulated radioactivity in source organ r h\\nh ) = 𝐶𝐶 ∑ 𝑦𝑦 i 𝐸𝐸 i ∅ i (𝑟𝑟 k ←𝑟𝑟 h ) i 𝑚𝑚 k , Eq. 3\\nwith y i the yield of the emitted radiation type i having energy E i [MeV], ∅ i (𝑟𝑟 k ← 𝑟𝑟 h ) the fraction of energy emitted from the source organ r h that is absorbed in the target organ r k , m k [kg] the mass of the target organ and C [Gy•kg•MBq -1\\n•s -1\\n•MeV\\n-1\\n] some proportionality constant.\\nAs in 131 I radioiodine therapy in DTC, the main part of the absorbed radiation dose is delivered by the so-called non-penetrating β --particles and the radioiodine distribution is characterized by a high focal lesion uptake and very little uptake in other tissues, the lesion absorbed dose is primarily caused by the self-absorbed dose resulting from the radioiodine activity present in the lesion itself. As a result, equation 1 can be approximated to\\n𝐷𝐷(𝑟𝑟 k )/𝐴𝐴 0 = 𝜏𝜏 k 𝑆𝑆(𝑟𝑟 k ← 𝑟𝑟 k ).\\nEq. 4\\nUnder the assumption that Eq. 6\\nJentzen et al. [67] demonstrated that the residence time τ k can in good approximation be determined from the 24 and 96 hours 131 I uptake after administration using a single exponential fit through both measurements and assuming linear uptake during the first 8 hours after iodine intake as shown in Figure 1.3. According to equation 2 the residence time τ k is determined by dividing the (grey) area under the time-activity-curve 𝐴𝐴 ̃𝑘𝑘 by the administered amount of radioiodine A 0 .\\nAfter assessment of the lesion volume, which is in practice often determined from the 124 I PET images, the self-absorbed dose per unit cumulated activity 𝑆𝑆(𝑟𝑟 k ← 𝑟𝑟 k ) can be estimated using the assumption of a spherically shaped lesion, for instance in Olinda [68]. Finally, the lesion absorbed dose during radioiodine therapy is calculated using equation 4.\\nExcept for the application of personalized radioiodine therapy, dosimetry is also required to assess radiation dose of other people, for instance visitors and personnel, as a result of the exposure to ionizing radiation. Due to the large amounts of radioactivity used in radionuclide therapy, protective measures such as the placement of shielding material in the walls are required to protect people outside the treatment rooms. As the materials used for this shielding (typically lead) are in general rather expensive and heavy, the application of accurate dosimetry methods is essential to achieve an optimal shielding design that fulfills the legal requirements in a cost-effective way. In general, analytical shielding calculations are performed using the readily available narrow beam linear attenuation coefficients of the shielding material [69,70] in combination with broad beam buildup factors [71] to account for the contribution of radiation scattered in the shielding material itself. In practice, however, shielding is often only applied to heights below the suspended ceiling resulting in typical shielding heights of 2 -2.5 m. It was shown that it can be important to take the contribution of ceiling scatter into account for the shielding of X-ray facilities such as CT-scanners [72]. However, data on the contribution of ceiling scatter of γ-radiation commonly encountered in nuclear medicine radionuclide therapy are lacking. Moreover, as the amount of ceiling scatter cannot easily be analytically calculated, the amount of ceiling scatter is often neglected. Monte Carlo-based modeling has become a widely used technique in radiation protection calculations [73]. In Monte Carlo methods the various interaction processes of ionizing radiation with materials can be modeled from known probability density functions [74]. Simulation of the physical process is then performed by using random sampling from the probability density functions. To obtain accurate calculations, large numbers of individual events (histories) are required. Generally, Monte Carlo simulations allow to study photon interaction effects that cannot easily be determined from direct measurements. For the application of radioprotection, the radiation dose resulting from ionizing radiation traveling over the shielding materials present in the walls and scattering of the ceiling can be determined using Monte Carlo simulations. This allows for costeffective improved shielding designs in nuclear medicine facilities.\\nThe overall aim of this thesis is to improve radiation dose assessment in radioiodine treatment in DTC, both for the application of personalized patient treatment using quantitative 124 I PET imaging and radiation protection of personnel and the general population. With respect to patient management, the application of lesion dosimetry based on pre-therapeutic 124 I PET may provide valuable prognostic information and allow for personalized treatment, minimizing the risk of under-or overdosing. From the perspective of radiation protection, accurate dosimetry may result in improved shielding designs in radionuclide therapy facilities and substantially reduce construction costs. In Chapter 2 an overview of personalized dosimetry approaches and relevant developments for molecular nuclear therapy is presented. Due to the complicated nature of radionuclide therapy, establishment of dose-effect relations require multidisciplinary efforts directed at patient specific techniques, using advanced equipment and (post-)processing. In Chapter Radiation dose calculations are also important in the shielding design of nuclear medicine examination and treatment rooms. In practice, the shielding in the walls is limited to a height lower than the actual ceiling height and radiation traveling over the shielding material and scattered by the ceiling may result in radiation dose that is often not accounted for in radiation dose calculations. In Chapter 6, the contribution of ceiling scatter to the radiation outside nuclear medicine rooms is determined by means of Monte Carlo simulations. \\nDosimetry in molecular nuclear therapy is still greatly in development. The number of cases where biological outcome correlates with calculated dose has risen promisingly (see e.g. the reviews by Stabin [1] and Bardiès and Buvat [2]), after a long period in which such correlations hardly appeared existent [3]. These findings, the growing application of molecular nuclear therapy, and the success of dosimetry in external beam radiotherapy, explain the current interest in the subject and emphasize the importance of further efforts to improve dosimetry in radionuclide therapy. Dosimetry basically entails two steps, first, the determination of the spatial distribution of the radionuclide in the patient as a function of time, and second, the use of this distribution in the calculation of the distribution of the absorbed or biologically effective dose (BED). No generally accepted approach has yet been developed, and large differences exist in the dosimetric methods and their degree of sophistication [2,4]. Planar scintigraphy, SPECT/CT and PET/CT are all used for the acquisition of images for deriving activity distributions [5][6][7][8]. Many computer codes have been developed for the calculation of dose distributions. Some are very fast and based on simple mathematical phantoms, not necessarily representative for the individual patient, others are highly accurate but time consuming, using personalized Monte Carlo simulations taking the patient\\'s own anatomy into account [4,9,10].\\nIn analogy to the personalized approach in external beam dosimetry, it is to be expected that radionuclide dosimetry will also only reach its ultimate potential when accurate 3D-activity distributions and the patient\\'s own anatomy are used in the dose calculations [4,[11][12][13]. In fact a personalized approach is required by the EURATOM 97/43 directive [14], but is too rarely implemented today. According to Stabin [15] generic models for patients may result in dose estimates that are off by a factor of at least 2, whereas by using optimized personalized methods the uncertainty can be reduced to a value of perhaps 10-20%. The accuracy needed to predict biological outcome -on the one hand tumour control and on the other toxicity to organs at risk -still needs to be investigated.\\nAs no real standard methods exist, we will discuss relevant components of molecular nuclear therapy, and try to give sufficient insights into the literature.\\nWhat is known on radionuclide dosimetry: basic literature A classic source of techniques for the quantitative assessment of activity distributions is MIRD pamphlet no. 16 from 1999 [16], in which emphasis is still on planar imaging techniques. A general introduction to dosimetry for molecular nuclear therapy, based on the MIRD schema, is given by Stabin [17]. Two other relevant documents are the \"EANM Dosimetry Committee guidance document: good practice of clinical dosimetry reporting\" [18] and \"MIRD pamphlet no. 21: a generalized schema for radiopharmaceutical dosimetry -standardization of nomenclature\" [19]. The theory of a dosimetric model which also considers the effects of protracted exposure and varying dose rate, which are characteristics of radionuclide therapy, can be found in the work of Dale [20,21].\\nNearly the complete field of radionuclide therapy was recently covered in reviews in a single issue of the Quarterly Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging [2,[22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30].\\nIndependent of the imaging technique to be applied, decisions have to be made with respect to the number and the timing of image acquisitions after administration of the activity to the patient. The criterion is that the number of radioactive decays that occurred in any organ (or voxel) in the patient can be determined to a sufficient degree of accuracy.\\nIn many studies the number of time points is restricted to three for practical reasons. Some studies showed that in special cases two [31] or even one [32] point in time could provide dosimetric results comparable to those of more elaborate sampling schemes. In fact the number of points required depends on the pattern in which the activity increases and decreases in the patient\\'s organ or tissue after administration. Often this pattern can be described by a sum of exponential functions, and the number of data points should at least be twice the number of exponentials needed in the fit. Compartmental modelling can be advantageous [16,23]. MIRD pamphlet 16 advises to use \"one or two data points taken at some fraction of T e ; one near T e; and one or two other data points taken a ~3 × T e and 5 × T e \", with T e the effective half-time of the decrease of the radioactivity in the patient. Instructive considerations on the timing of sampling are given in Appendix D of MIRD pamphlet 16 [16].\\nIn principle, clinical PET/CT systems today have the highest potential for accurately determining three dimensional activity distributions in patients [7]. PET scanners have a sensitivity that is of the order of 100 times higher than that of a gamma camera (see e.g. Rault et al. [33]), and the corrections necessary for the various imperfections inherent in the PET-technology, i.e. attenuation, scattered radiation, random coincidences, variations in individual detector element sensitivity and dead time, have been implemented by all manufacturers. The high sensitivity allows the implementation of a good spatial resolution of about 5-7 mm and short acquisition times of a few minutes per bed position. Whole body scanning is possible, even repeatedly as generally necessary for dosimetry. The CT-data, by the scanner\\'s hybrid design co-registered with the PET data, also facilitate image registration of scans at different time points.\\nFor the successful application of PET/CT in radionuclide therapy one needs a pair of nuclides with the following properties: (i) one nuclide is suitable for therapy and the other for PET, and (ii) after coupling to the pharmaceutical to be used in imaging and therapy, the two radiopharmaceuticals have biologically identical properties or identical distributions. This will automatically be the case if both nuclides are of the same element, but this is not a necessary condition. The lack of such pairs limits the use of PET/CT. The most favourable combination currently is that of the widely therapeutically used 131 I and the positron emitter 124 I. For dosimetric studies 124 I has a conveniently long half-life of 4.176 days, but it suffers from a relatively low positron abundance of 23% and the presence of additional gamma radiation (mainly of 603 keV) which is partially in coincidence with positron emission. Coincidences between gammas exist too, for instance between the 603 and 723 keV gammas [34]. The quantification of activity in 124 I PET(/CT) has been studied in considerable detail [9,13,22,[35][36][37][38][39][40][41].  [37,38,[41][42][43]. Recently, also the presence of internal positron-electron pair production in 90 Y itself was utilized for patient imaging [44,45]. The internal pair production, of which the positron is the relevant particle, has a probability of (31.86 ± 0.47) × 10\\n-6 [46]. This phenomenon might especially be used to verify the activity distribution after administration of large amounts of activity for therapy, e.g. after selective internal radiotherapy using resin or glass spheres. Other therapy-PET pairs are 67 Cu- 64 Cu, and 89 Sr-83 Sr [47]. The problem of the presence of additional gammas in 124 I and 86 Y can be overcome [37,41]. These radiations result in a uniform background in the sinogram, which, at least for 124 I is already rather well removed by the standard single scatter simulation correction algorithm [22,48,49]. The result of the scatter simulation is scaled with the tails of the sinogram, and this step, although not strictly correct for removing a constant background, accounts for the elimination of gamma-annihilation coincidences [22], probably even causing some overcorrection [41]. The delayed-window random coincidence correction also takes care of the random gamma-gamma coincidences. Narrowing the energy window around 511 keV within which gamma radiation is accepted, might also help to improve both image quality and quantification by reducing the contribution of 603 keV gamma events [37,50].\\nThe 3D-activity distributions obtained are used for the calculation of the absorbed dose and other dose parameters. When the classical MIRD scheme is to be applied, organ volumes of interest (VOIs) have to be defined around all source organs, and the activities as a function of time within these VOIs have to be derived. VOIs can be defined either on PET or CT, or on an overlay of both. This generally only has to be done at one time point, as the VOIs can be copied to the other image sets. Before copying the VOIs to the PET images, these should be co-registered by using e.g. the low-dose CT data sets. Small shifts of VOIs may still be necessary. Alternatively one could also shift all VOIs without image co-registration. Normalized time activity curves have to be calculated for all organs and tissues of interest by dividing the activity in a given VOI by the activity given to the patient.\\nWhen using a (personalized) voxel model in the calculations, the image sets must again be co-registered carefully to ensure that a certain voxel in image space corresponds with the same piece of tissue at the different time points. In this way normalized time activity curves per voxel become available. These can be used as input for personalized dose calculations, using CT data as a personal template for the patient. VOI definition is in principle only necessary for the target organs including tumours, on the one hand to define radiobiological parameters for that organ, on the other hand to be able to evaluate to dosimetric results (e.g. the dose-volume histogram) within the target [13,20,21,23,51,52].\\nIt has been shown in many phantom studies that SPECT/CT allows a relatively accurate absolute quantification of activity [53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62], typically within about 10-20%. CT-based corrections for attenuation and scatter, and some resolution recovery by modelling the detector response and collimator properties, have been implemented by all major vendors.\\nDue to the lower sensitivity of a gamma camera, acquisition times in SPECT mode are long, in clinical practice probably too long for single or repeated whole body acquisitions. This remains true even if the acquisition time would be halved, as has been shown to be possible for dosimetry [63]. Hybrid acquisition solutions have been proposed to overcome these long scan times [62,64]. In the hybrid approach one or more SPECT studies are made at one point in time, and at all other time points only conjugate view planar images are acquired. Using the 3D-information from the SPECT or CT acquisition, volumes of interest can be defined around all source organs and tissues of interest. Assuming that at all times the activity distribution within a given VOI is uniform, the actual concentration can be estimated in an iterative process. The activity in the VOIs, in the to-be-reconstructed image at the times where the 3D-information is missing, is iteratively adjusted until the projections match the measured planar images. Alternatively one can assume that the activities in a VOI at different points in time only differ by a scaling factor. In this reconstruction process, corrections for attenuation, scatter and system limitations can be implemented. In computer simulations and phantom studies the results were very similar to those obtained in a full SPECT study [62,64]. However, in patient studies the distribution pattern of the activity within an organ or tumour might change over time.\\nNormalized time activity curves can be reconstructed in the same way as described for PET/CT. Effects of small changes in size and position of volumes of interest on activity estimation have also been studied by He and Frey. In their simulations the effects were of limited magnitude, and largest for small organs [65].\\nWhole body imaging using a conjugate pair of detectors of a gamma camera [16] is even today probably the mainstay of image acquisition for dosimetry. Whole body acquisition can be performed relatively fast, typically in about 10-20 min. Many implementations for the analysis of the images exist, which differ in the way in which the various corrections that are required for absolute quantification of activity are realized. Many details can be found in MIRD pamphlet 16 [16] and the work of Geworski et al. [8].\\nAttenuation correction can be done by means of a transmission scan using a flood source with activity of the radionuclide used for dosimetry, in combination with a blank scan to define 100% transmission. Alternatively, the thickness of the patient can be estimated, and together with an experimentally determined effective attenuation coefficient, be used for attenuation correction. In the latter approach scatter correction is then taken into account by an attenuation correction that is lower than the narrowbeam value. Scatter correction can also be performed using the double or triple energywindow method.\\nA method for the non-trivial correction for dead time (or count loss) during whole body scanning with a continuously moving bed, as might be necessary for patients receiving high therapeutic activities, has been proposed by Hobbs et al. [66].\\nThere are several shortcomings inherent in the whole body conjugate view method. Corrections for scatter and attenuation are only approximate, and there are the problems of organ-overlap and properly choosing a background region to correct for overlying tissue. Many studies have shown that the accuracy of this planar method is poor [55,56,62,64,[67][68][69][70][71]. Note that in the studies of He et al. [56,64] a relatively simple version of the whole body method was applied. Remarkably, more satisfactory findings were reported in a number of older studies [72][73][74]. The current consensus appears to be that the planar approach is not suitable for therapy, but that the limited accuracy might be acceptable for the evaluation of general dosimetric properties of radiopharmaceuticals (like biodistribution and organ and effective dose per unit of activity).\\nMore recently, several improvements of the conjugate view technique have been tested, generally involving special reconstruction software. One is to use a single set of 3D image data, e.g. from CT, for defining volumes of interest around all organs and tissues of interest, as proposed by He et al. [56,64]. By assuming uniform activity in all VOIs, and taking system properties into account, one can iteratively estimate the activities in the various VOIs from the conjugate anterior and posterior images by using a suitable reconstruction algorithm, as was already explained above for a hybrid planar/SPECT method. The assumption of uniform activity distributions remains a limitation. The accuracy appears to be limited especially for small organs. The effect of misregistration of volumes of interest has been investigated by Song et al. [75].\\nOnce sets of images with an estimate of the activity in the patient have been calculated at different time points, quantification of activity in all relevant organs and tissues has to be performed. Alternatively, activity can be assessed at the voxel level. The choice depends on the method to be applied for the dose calculation. The residence time for an organ or voxel is obtained by integration over time of the normalized time activity curve. Effectively it is the hypothetical time that a source of constant strength, with the activity equal to what is administered to the patients, has to stay at that location to provide as many disintegrations as the actually present, over-time-varying activity did.\\nIn some cases it may be possible to use a known biokinetic model and determine the model parameters from several time activity curves together (e.g. from blood and some organs). The fitted model parameters can be used to calculate the time activity curves in the various compartments (e.g. organs), and from those curves the corresponding residence times can in turn be calculated.\\nMIRD pamphlet 16 [16] in its Appendix D considers when potential errors may be introduced: (i) uptake is not instantaneous whilst assuming is was, (ii) a fast wash-out component is missed due to undersampling, and (iii) the long-term retention is not completely determined. Appendix E of the pamphlet gives calculational examples for these cases. Flux et al. [76] described how to estimate uncertainties in absorbed dose calculations due to inconsistent or inaccurate activity retention measurements.\\nThe simplest approach applied in radionuclide therapy is not to perform any dosimetry at all, a procedure that might be characterized as \"one dose fits all\". This is, for instance, still applied in many places in the radioiodine treatment of thyroid disorders. The activity given to a patient for one and the same disease may also differ greatly between institutions. There is also no dosimetry advised for the treatment of lymphoma using 90 Y Zevalin. Note that this is against European guidelines which require individualized do-simetry [14]. Moreover, many authors have given convincing arguments for a personalized approach [1,11,12,77]. Absorbed dose calculations over the years have been performed using the MIRD methodology as implemented in the Mirdose program [78], and more recently, in its successor Olinda/EXM [79]. These software codes take the residence times of activity in all source organs as input. Both have models for anthropomorphic phantoms of different age and sex, as well as models of pregnant woman at 3, 6 and 9 month pregnancy.\\nOlinda/EXM allows for adjustment of organ mass, however, this adjustment is only used to adapt the self-dose. It also has a module for the estimation of the self-dose of spherical tumours.\\nRadiobiological modelling was introduced in radionuclide therapy, as in external beam therapy, to account for dose rate and tissue repair effects [4,20,21,23]. Central to this approach are the parameters α and β, the coefficients of the linear and quadratic dose terms in the linear-quadratic dose response model, and µ, the time constant characterizing tissue repair (instead of µ an effective half-time t e = ln(2)/µ may be seen). The model permits the calculation of a hypothetical reference dose for any practical exposure, the so-called biologically effective dose (BED), which, given with a very low doserate or in infinitely small dose fractions, would have the same biological effect as the actual exposure. This model allows for instance the use of data from external beam therapy to estimate the effect of radionuclide therapy (or vice versa). For a tissue consisting of similar units (\"parallel organization\", or \"function scaling with size\"), as in e.g. the liver or possibly a tumour, the BED-distribution allows the calculation of an equivalent uniform dose (EUD), the uniform dose that would have to be given to the organ or tumour to give the same effect (e.g. cell killing or organ failure) as the actual nonuniform distribution would do.\\nFor the determination of organ doses and the effective dose of a radiopharmaceutical for diagnostic imaging, the MIRD approach as implemented in Mirdose/Olinda is believed to give an acceptable accuracy, notwithstanding the fact that a patient\\'s anatomy generally will not match with that of one of the phantoms. In therapy a higher accuracy is required which cannot be guaranteed by this standard approach. Marine et al.\\n[80] calculated specific absorbed fractions (SAFs) for adults with statures between the 10 th and 90 th percentile of the general population. Differences in SAFs amounted up to 15-30% for self-irradiation of organs in the trunk, and were up to about 8-33% for organs irradiating other organs. In another study by Divoli et al. patient specific SAFs were calculated with OEDIPE [81] and compared with the SAFs from Olinda/EXM. Relatively large differences were found as well, but when organ mass was correctly taken into account in Olinda/EXM, the differences were smaller than 26%. These authors also showed that using a dose kernel derived for water density can result in large errors of up to 60% in the calculated absorbed dose in the lungs. Clark et al. showed that obesity had a very small effect on SAFs, only in the abdomen did mesenteric adipose tissue increase the distance between organs and lower the SAFs [82].\\nUsing 3D-information, available from PET/CT or SPECT/CT, patient specific dose calculations have been performed by several groups. Several methods can be distinguished, but they all rely in some way or another on Monte Carlo simulations: (i) SAFbased methods, (ii) dose kernel methods, and (iii) Monte Carlo calculations for the individual patient. SAF-based methods apply either fixed mathematical phantoms, or they are voxel based, but then they pertain to soft-tissue only. A dose kernel describes the absorbed dose as a function of the distance of a point source. Kernel methods derive absorbed dose distributions by the convolution of a dose kernel and the patient\\'s activity distribution [83]. The commercially available Stratos software, which is part of the translational and research workstation Imalytics (Philips Technology GmbH, Aachen, Germany), is also based on this approach. Stratos includes tools for segmentation, image co-registration, 3D visualization, fusion display, and the calculation of dose tables and dose volume histograms. It will support hybrid imaging [84]. The disadvantage of the kernel approach is that is does not easily allow taking local differences in tissue (in composition and density) into account, e.g. between soft-tissue, lung and bone. Loudos et al.\\n[85] described a kernel method in which these density differences are taken into account to some extent.\\nSeveral groups have developed different 3D software packages: 3D-ID/3D-RD by the group at Johns Hopkins [51], now based on EGS and including biological dose modelling and already used in clinical applications; RMDP from the Royal Marsden group, uses either beta kernels or voxel SAFs, and includes a routine to simulate photon interactions in a collimator and the gamma camera crystal [86]; DOSE3D from the Institut Gustave-Roussy uses the EGS4 Monte Carlo code to calculate doses for anthropomorphic phantoms with organs whose shape can be changed and to which spheres can be added [87,88]; OEDIPE uses MCNP to calculate either doses at the organ or voxel level [81, 89, 90]; MINERVA is an extension to the external beam treatment planning program PEREGRINE developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and includes tools for radionuclide therapy [91,92].\\nPersonalized dosimetry using 3D PET/CT or SPECT/CT data is still an area of active research, and it still may take some time before a widely accepted standard package has found its way to the users who now still apply Olinda/EXM or refrain from any form of dosimetry at all.\\nWhen trying to maximize the dose to tumour tissue, a limit to the maximum activity that can be given to a patient is usually set by toxicity to a critical organ, often the red marrow or the kidney. For organs containing a tumour, like the liver or the lung, the host organ itself could also be the critical organ. Estimation of an acceptable dose is complicated because radiation tolerance in radionuclide therapy varies among individuals, with influence of genetic makeup, age and previous therapies.\\nMeredith et al. reviewed the risks to normal tissue from radionuclide therapy [93]. They noted that the tolerance of normal tissue often appeared to be greater than in external beam radiotherapy, but at the same time more variable. These findings were largely attributed to differences in dosimetry methodology and to heterogeneous dose distributions of the radionuclides. They further pointed out the importance of an individualized approach, the application of radiobiological modelling and the use of dosevolume histograms. The latter are relevant because toxicity is not only dependent on dose, but also on the relative volume that receives a given dose. In addition, Meredith et al. provided a valuable overview with a comparison of normal organ radiation tolerance for external beam and beta-emitter radionuclide therapy.\\nRed marrow is widely distributed over the skeleton, its amount and distribution change with age, and it has a complicated microstructure which also changes over time. These characteristics cause red marrow dosimetry to be complicated [94]. At the same time it is the most radiosensitive tissue in the body, making red marrow dosimetry often necessary in radionuclide therapy.\\nThe method for determining the dose to the red marrow depends on the distribution of the radiopharmaceutical used [95]. Decisive is whether there is specific binding of activity in the red marrow or bone, either by normal physiology or by pathology. If no activity is specifically bound, the activity in the red marrow is due to activity in the blood plasma or blood cells (or both), and blood-based dosimetry can in principle be performed. Instead of applying such blood-based dosimetry, whole body dosimetry has been used in some cases for the prediction of red marrow toxicity as well [96,97]. If activity is bound to marrow or bone, imaging-based methods are normally applied [98].\\nSeveral authors assessed available methods to estimate red marrow dose. Wessels et al. [99] performed a multi-institutional comparison of blood-based models [100], finding a mean ratio of 0.920 ± 0.259 for dose estimates according to the participating institutions compared with the central laboratory value. Hindorf et al. evaluated seven methods, of which four blood-based techniques, a method based on the imaging of the sacrum, and two total body approximations, to obtain estimates of the red marrow dose [101]. The ratio of the maximum and the minimum absorbed dose to red marrow, calculated using the four blood and sacral imaging methods for one and the same patient, varied between 1.8 and 2.8. Ferrer et al. studied two blood-based methods and a lumbar vertebrae imaging-based method and found that doses from imaging predicted haematological toxicity best [102]. A risk of using blood-based methods is the underestimation of the red marrow dose due to bound activity that goes undetected. Even small amounts of e.g. 90 Y bound in the marrow can increase the absorbed dose substantially [103,104].\\nAlthough quantification of the red marrow dose is of limited accuracy at present, standardization of dose assessment methods has its value as it allows comparison of results from different institutions. In this light, guidelines from professional societies are very important. The EANM issued two documents, \"EANM Dosimetry Committee guidelines for bone marrow and whole-body dosimetry\" [95], and \"Blood and bone marrow dosimetry in differentiated thyroid cancer therapy\" [105]. The reader is referred to these detailed documents for all practical information needed for performing bone marrow dosimetry in clinical practice. Both guidelines allow for some patient specific adjustments (e.g. based on weight or bone marrow mass), but as discussed by Hindorf et al. this could be taken further to 3D-measurements using PET/CT or SPECT/CT imaging and patient specific voxel-based calculations [95]. Hindorf et al. [95] state \"Demonstration of the relationships between absorbed dose and biological effect for bone marrow toxicity from radionuclide therapy have proven elusive, although it is likely that these exist for radionuclide therapy also\". In part this lack of correlation will be due to inaccuracies in the difficult dosimetry, but two additional points with respect to this dosimetry still have to be considered here. In most of the literature on red marrow dosimetry cited above only the absorbed dose is considered, not the biologically effective dose as should be. However, Baechler et al. showed that for four commonly applied radionuclides and normal therapy conditions the BED and the absorbed dose are nearly identical for red marrow [106]. The BED formalism may thus be of limited relevance for red marrow dosimetry (but not taken into account in their study was cell repopulation as might occur in the fast responding red marrow [106]). Further, many authors attribute the poor correlation between red marrow or whole body dose and the commonly used indicators for bone marrow suppression, like thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and neutropenia, at least in part to the damage to red marrow cells and their micro-environment caused by previous treatments [107,108]. This is corroborated by Siegel et al., who reported improved correlations between haematological toxicity and bone marrow dose if the plasma FLT3-L cytokine level -considered as a marker of radiosensitivity -was taken into account [109].\\nThe kidney is generally the organ most at risk in peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), as low molecular-weight radionuclide conjugates are mainly excreted by the kidney where a fraction is reabsorbed, causing potentially high doses locally [27,110,111]. This uptake can be reduced to some extent by the co-infusion of certain aminoacids (lysine, arginine), albumin fragments or Gelofusin, depending on the peptide used for therapy [112]. Dosimetry is commonly based on the MIRD approach. A very large variability in kidney toxicity was observed when the traditional approach was applied whereby the kidney is considered a single unit with a uniform uptake of activity. To improve accuracy, patient specific kidney mass, the locoregional distribution of the radioactivity retained, transit times through the kidneys, and dose rate effects should be taken into account [113]. Other factors affecting kidney radiation toxicity which may be more difficult to take into account are hypertension, diabetes, age, chemotherapy and loss of renal function [112,114].\\nIn 2003 MIRD-pamphlet 19 appeared in which six age-dependent multiregion models for the kidney were presented [115], including specific absorbed fractions for dosimetric calculations. The regions distinguished were the renal cortex, the medullary pyramids, the papillae and the renal pelvis. For 90 Y-compounds used in adults, the absorbed dose to the renal cortex was about 1.29 times the dose predicted by the singlekidney region model, while the dose to the medulla was 0.26 times that for the singlekidney dose. High quality imaging, preferably 3D, is required for the application of this approach. One PET-based method, applied to 90 Y PRRT but probably also useful for other PET nuclides, was described by Walrand et al. [116].\\nFor the kidney, biological modelling is important under the circumstances that are typical for radionuclide therapy. This was shown using the linear-quadratic (LQ) model [106,113,117], and a model based on time-dose fractionating (TDF) [118]. MIRD pamphlet 20 gives instructive examples for the LQ model. Improved correlation between radiation dose and toxicity was obtained after biological modelling had been introduced and functional differences in the kidney had been taken into account [119].\\nIn comparison to dosimetry for external beam radiotherapy, radionuclide dosimetry faces several additional challenges. First the quantification of the source of radiation, i.e. the activity distribution, is affected by the finite spatial resolution of current nuclear medicine imaging equipment. Activity recovery-coefficients for spheres or ellipsoids with volumes of about 1 cm 3 are substantially below one, even with PET [39]. Smallscale activity inhomogeneities remain undetected, implying that the activity distribution in small irregular structures of e.g. a tumour will be unknown. Depending on the radiation emitted by the radionuclide used for therapy, small scale inhomogeneities can have a large effect on the local absorbed dose [120, 121]. There are still additional issues related to microdosimetry, especially when the therapeutic nuclide emits low-energy electrons or α-particles [15,122,123]. Another potential problem is the high amount of activity used in therapy affecting the binding properties of the target, causing another biodistribution than previously observed after administration of the small amount of activity for dosimetry. Finally, pretargeted radioimmunotherapy [124], combinational therapy, for instance with two different targeting radiopharmaceuticals [125], or with a targeting radionuclide and external beam therapy [126,127], are still largely unexplored fields.\\nDosimetry in molecular nuclear therapy is currently a field of very active research. Given the complicated nature of radionuclide therapy, multidisciplinary efforts should be directed at patient specific techniques, using the most advanced instrumental and numerical methods available. Only then may it be possible to establish useful dose-effect relations in molecular nuclide therapy. I-sodium iodide. Lesions were identified as thyroid remnants or metastases (lymph node, lung, bone). After a neoteric segmentation technique allowing accurate volume estimation down to the 124 I PET spatial resolution of 0.15 mL was applied, lesions were divided into a known-volume group and a small-volume group. For the known-volume group, average lesion absorbed dose (AD) values were calculated, whereas for the small-volume group a minimum lesion AD was estimated. Lesion response was determined on the basis of124 I PET/CT and 131 I SPECT(/CT) follow-up images. A lesion not detectable on any of the follow-up images was considered a completely responding lesion. Differences in lesion AD estimations between completely and incompletely responding lesions were evaluated by Mann-Whitney U test. Moreover, receiver-operator-characteristic curves were used to test the performance of pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/CT lesion AD for prediction of complete lesion response.\\nIn the approach of fixed radioiodine activity (3.0 ± 1.0 GBq), 89% of thyroid remnants and 69% of metastases responded completely. Except for the small-volume groups, the lesion AD of completely responding lesions was significantly higher than that of incompletely responding lesions. Using receiver-operator-characteristic curve analysis, it was shown that for the known-volume group, pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/CT lesion dosimetry can be used as a prognostic tool to predict lesion-based 131 I therapy response with an area under the curve of 0.76 for remnants and 0.97 for metastases. The corresponding lesion AD threshold value maximizing correct complete response prediction was 90 Gy for remnants and 40 Gy for metastases.\\nIn a fixed-activity approach, a statistically significant dose-response relationship for both thyroid remnants and metastases using pre-therapeutic\\nRadioiodine therapy is the standard adjuvant therapy, after total thyroidectomy in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) [1,2]. The purpose of radioiodine therapy is 2-fold: ablation of thyroid remnants and treatment of radioiodine-avid metastases.\\nThe generally accepted threshold for lesion absorbed dose (AD) to achieve high therapy response is 85 Gy for metastases and 300 Gy for thyroid remnants [3,4]. To predict therapy response, a reliable AD estimation requires, inter alia, accurate lesion volume determination, which is hampered by the often small lesion volumes with respect to the spatial resolution of 131 I scintigraphy and lesion segmentation difficulties encountered in ultrasonography, CT, or other imaging modalities [1,5]. As a result, personalized radioiodine therapy based on lesion dosimetry is not globally adopted. In general, a fixed 131 I activity is administered on the basis of disease characteristics and patient age, with the risk of under-or overtreatment [6].\\nSeveral groups have concluded that quantitation of 124 I PET images is feasible [7][8][9][10][11]. Compared with 131 I SPECT, 124 I PET imaging offers a higher image spatial resolution, increased counting rate sensitivity, and higher quantitative capacity, resulting in the application of pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/CT-based lesion dosimetry [12][13][14][15][16][17].\\nTo date, the only study assessing the dose-response relationship using 124 I PET/CT in a larger number of patients was recently published by Jentzen et al. [17]. Pretherapeutic 124 I PET/CT lesion AD estimation and toxicity assessment were taken into consideration in patient management, allowing the administration of an optimized therapeutic activity (8.0 ± 4.3 GBq). However, using a fixed-activity approach in the absence of toxicity assessment generally results in lower administered 131 I activity than the optimized therapeutic activity. Consequently, it is expected that the lesion ADs in the fixed-activity approach are lower than the values published by Jentzen et al. [17], possibly resulting in more lesions that receive a lesion AD below the established threshold values.\\nTherefore, the aim of this study was to assess the dose-response relationship in an approach of a fixed therapeutic 131 I activity in a large group of patients using pretherapeutic 124 I PET/CT lesion dosimetry. Moreover, a new segmentation technique allowing volume estimation down to the PET spatial resolution of 124 I was used [18]. In addition, we assessed the feasibility of performing pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/CT lesion dosimetry as a prognostic tool to predict therapy response in DTC patients in a fixedactivity approach.\\n\\nThis study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. In the Maastricht University Medical Centre, pretherapeutic imaging with I SPECT/CT as part the radioiodine therapy was available. For patients who underwent multiple radioiodine therapies preceded by 124 I PET/CT examinations, only the data of the first radioiodine therapy were included. Patient TNM status was characterized in 4 stages according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Atlas [19]. Moreover, the maximum thyroglobulin value recorded within 1 y after 131 I ablation therapy was reported. Until March 2011, thyroglobulin was measured using a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (Autodelfia; PerkinElmer) with a limit of detection of 0.5 pmol/L. From March 2011, thyroglobulin was measured using a timeresolved amplified cryptate emission assay (Brahms GmbH; Thermo Fisher) with a limit of detection of 0.25 pmol/L. Abnormal (positive) results were recorded if thyroglobulin was greater than 1.5 pmol/L. In the case of incomplete recovery of the antibody used in the assay, additional testing was done for specific antithyroglobulin antibodies.\\nPatient preparation was done by thyroid hormone withdrawal or recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) and was similar for the pre-and follow-up 124 I PET/CT examinations. In the case of thyroid hormone withdrawal, patients were withdrawn from thyroxine medication for 4-6 weeks, or remained without medication postoperatively. In the cases of rhTSH preparation, 0.9 mg of thyrotropin alfa or rhTSH (Thyrogen; Genzyme Ltd.) was injected intramuscularly on days 1 and 2, afterward 124 I was orally administered on day 4, and 124 I PET/CT was performed on day 5 (24 h after 124 I administration) and day 8 (96 h after 124 I administration). For radioiodine therapy, a fixed-activity protocol was performed according to the Dutch guidelines, using 2.8 GBq (75 mCi) for simple thyroid remnant ablation and 5.6 GBq (150 mCi) for regional nodal disease or distant metastases. 124 I PET scans were acquired from the head, neck and thorax comprising 4-5 bed positions of 4 min each. In selected cases, imaging was continued until the pelvis. A low-dose spiral CT scan from the head to thigh was acquired (tube voltage, 120 kVp; effective tube current, 30 mAs; slice thickness, 4 mm), followed by the PET acquisition and supplemental high-dose CT without contrast (neck, 120 kV; 150 mAs, slice thickness, 2 mm; increment, 1.8; and thorax, 120 kV; 175 mAs; slice thickness, 5 mm; increment, 4.0). All CT images were reconstructed using the filtered backprojection algorithm. PET images were reconstructed using the line of response-based, time-of-flight reconstruction algorithm provided by the manufacturer with a voxel size of 4 × 4 × 4 mm 3 . In addition, for accurate lesion volume assessment and quantification purposes, PET images were retrospectively reconstructed with a voxel size of 2 × 2 × 2 mm 3 . For all PET images, standard corrections for attenuation, scatter, decay, and dead-time were performed. The 131 I whole-body scintigraphy was made as a total-body scan from top until toe using a table speed of 10 cm/min. SPECT/CT was acquired immediately after wholebody scintigraphy.\\n131 I SPECT/CT was acquired using a standard SPECT/CT camera, (Precedence SPECT/6-slice CT scanner; Philips) equipped with dual 1.6 cm γ-detectors with high-energy general-purpose collimators. SPECT data were obtained by a noncircular orbit, a 128 × 128 matrix (voxel size, 4.7 × 4.7 × 4.7 mm\\n3\\n) and 32 angles over 180° and 45 s per stop, using a 364-keV photo peak with 10% window (total acquisition time, 24 min). Reconstruction space and width was 3 mm using the Philips Astonish algorithm.\\nThe volume of each lesion with focal uptake, present on both of the pre-therapeutic 124 I PET images (24 and 96 h after administration) was semi-automatically determined using an in-house-built software algorithm (Matlab; The Mathworks) based on a recently published iterative thresholding method [18]. The method assumes a spherically shaped lesion with homogeneous 124 I uptake. Accounting for the reconstructed 124 I PET spatial resolution of 6.7 mm (expressed as full-width at half maximum), background-corrected relative boundary-reproducing values used for lesion delineation were calculated. The smallest diameter or volume that can be determined using this method corresponds to the PET spatial resolution or its equivalent sphere volume of 0.15 mL. Consequently, lesions were classified into 2 groups in line with a previous study [17]: lesions with reliable volume estimation larger than 0.15 mL, the so-called known-volume group, and lesions with a volume smaller than 0.15 mL, the small-volume group. For the knownvolume group, the lesion volume was calculated as the average value of the lesion vol-ume determined on the 24 and 96 h 124 I PET images. Lesions for which the average lesion volume differed more than 30% with respect to the 24 or 96 h volume were excluded. Lesions for which either the 24 or 96 h volume was smaller than 0.15 mL were classified into the small-volume group. For the small-volume group, the lesion volume used for lesion AD estimation was assumed to be equal to the PET spatial resolution volume of 0.15 mL.\\nFor each 124 I PET image, lesion uptake was calculated as the average activity concentration of the segmented volume, corrected for partial volume effect, using measured (absolute) recovery coefficients [18], which effectively corrects for prompt γcoincidence effect as well [20]. Assuming identical 124 I and 131 I pharmacokinetics, halflife correction was performed on the 124 I activity concentration to assess the projected 131 I activity concentration. 131 I residence time was determined according to the adapted 2-points approach [21]. In the case the effective half-life was less than the physical 131 I half-life, the lesion time-activity curve was parameterized using a combination of a linear uptake function and a mono-exponential decay function (interception time at 8 h after 131 I administration). In the case the effective half-life was greater than the 131 I physical half-life, physical decay was assumed beyond the 96 h time point. The (selfirradiation) lesion AD was calculated using the sphere model in the Olinda software package (Olinda version 1.1; Vanderbilt University) [22]. For all lesions, a density of 1.0 g/mL was used, resulting in an average and a minimum lesion AD per administered 131 I activity for the known-volume and small-volume groups, respectively. The predicted average and minimum lesion AD delivered in radioiodine therapy were estimated by multiplication with the therapeutic 131 I activity.\\nLesion-based analysis Lesions were classified as either thyroid remnants or metastases including lymph node or distant metastases (lymph node, lung, bone). Both the thyroid remnants and the metastases were subdivided into a known-volume group and a small-volume group. Each individual lesion was either defined as completely or incompletely responding by an experienced nuclear medicine physician and medical physicist. Specifically, the completely responding lesion did not show 124 I uptake on subsequent follow-up scanning within 1 y and no 131 I uptake on subsequent post-therapeutic planar and SPECT/CT scanning. In contrast, the incompletely responding lesion did show focal 124 I or 131 I uptake on the day-4 scan (in the absence of significant level of background noise), not contributable to physiologic uptake according to visual assessment. For each lesion group, the predicted lesion AD in radioiodine therapy of the completely responding lesions was compared with that of the incompletely responding lesions. Moreover, the performance of pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/CT to predict complete lesion response was assessed using receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis [23].\\nPatients were classified as incompletely responding if persisting disease after radioiodine therapy was demonstrated, either by functional imaging ( 124 I PET/CT, 131 I SPECT/CT, 18 F-FDG), anatomic imaging (ultrasonography, MRI), histology or increased thyroglobulin value. Otherwise patients were classified as completely responding. The average patient-based lesion AD was calculated as the mean lesion AD of all radioiodine-avid lesions observed per patient.\\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22 (IBM Corp.). Descriptive data are shown as mean ± SD (median; range). Differences between 2 groups were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Values for P less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. ROC curves were used to test the performance of pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/CT lesion AD for the prediction of complete lesion response.\\n\\nDetailed patient characteristics are provided in Table 3 Detailed lesion characteristics are given in Table 3.2. In total, 168 lesions were suitable for AD estimation. Nine lesions were excluded because of lesion volume discrepancies in the 24 and 96 h scans. For the thyroid remnants and metastases, 89% (109/123) and 69% (31/45) of the lesions showed a complete response, respectively.\\nFigure 3.1 illustrates the calculated lesion AD in radioiodine therapy for both thyroid remnants and metastases for all lesions (including known-and small-volume group), the known-volume group and the small-volume group. A statistically significant higher lesion AD was observed for the completely responding lesions than the incompletely responding lesions for all lesions and the known-volume group, but not for the smallvolume remnants group. Because there were only 2 incompletely responding lesions in the small-volume metastases group, no statistical tests were performed for this group. Detailed lesion data are provided in the supplemental materials (available at http://jnm.snmjournals.org). Figure 3.2 shows the ROC curves for both the thyroid remnants and the metastases. Except for the metastatic small-volume group, all area under the curve values were significantly higher than 0.5. The area under the curve values were highest for the known-volume group. The arrow in Figure 3.2 corresponds to the established threshold values for the lesion AD of 300 Gy for thyroid remnants and 85 Gy for metastases [3,4].\\nFor the known-volume group, these threshold values resulted in sensitivity values of 0.69 and 0.67 and specificity values of 0.75 and 0.92 for the thyroid remnants and metastases, respectively. The Youden index [24], defined as the value that gives the maximum correct classification, was calculated as being 90 Gy for thyroid remnants and 40 Gy for metastases, resulting in respective sensitivity values of 0.85 and 1.0, and specificity values of 0.75 and 0.92.  \\nIn Table 3.1, it can be derived that the incompletely responding patients had a higher TNM status and considerably more radioiodine-avid metastases than the completely responding patients. The median patient-based thyroid remnant lesion AD was higher for the completely responding patients (370 Gy) than the incompletely responding patients (180 Gy) but this was not statistically significant. For metastases, the median patient-based lesion AD was higher for the incompletely responding patients (63 Gy) compared to the completely responding patients (39 Gy) but also not statistically significant. In 7 patients a complete response of all radioiodine-avid lesions was seen at the lesion-based analysis. However, in the patient-based analysis these did not have a complete response because during follow-up new lesions in other anatomic areas were detected with 18 F-FDG PET/CT, 124 I PET/CT or ultrasound in combination with cytology.\\nMaxon et al. [3,4] demonstrated that a lesion AD threshold of 300 Gy for thyroid remnants and 85 Gy for lymph node metastases was associated with a high complete lesion response rate of 80-90%, establishing the lesion AD as an important quantity for prediction of lesion response in radioiodine treatment. Several groups have identified 124 I PET/CT as a promising modality for performing lesion-based dosimetry [12][13][14][15][16][17]. Applying an empirically fixed radioiodine activity approach, Flower et al. [12] were the first to assess lesion AD in 3 patients using 124 I PET. In agreement with our findings, they reported that the administration of fixed activities (3.0-5.5 GBq) resulted in a large variation of lesion AD to both thyroid remnants (16-400 Gy) and involved neck nodes (2.5-33 Gy). In contrast, Erdi et al. [13] developed a method to estimate lesion AD of thyroid remnants based on pre-therapeutic 124 I PET imaging at maximum-tolerated activity of 131 I using a dose constraint of 2 Gy to blood. Performing this method in 3 patients, they observed a large lesion AD range (5-248 Gy) at maximum-tolerated activity (10-15.5 GBq). Indeed, an approach of maximum-tolerated activity applying a maximum blood dose of 2 Gy has been reported to be safe and well-tolerated [25][26][27]. Alternatively, several groups have reported on an optimal activity approach using pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/CT lesion AD calculations [14][15][16]. In this approach, 131 I therapeutic activity was chosen to achieve lesion AD values above the established threshold values, considering toxicity estimations. Although this approach has been reported to result in change in patient management in 25-50% of DTC patients [14,16], the biologic effectiveness of dosimetry-guided approaches is not proven yet [1].\\nTo date, the only study assessing the dose-response relationship by means of 124 PET/CT in a larger number of patients was recently published by Jentzen et al. [17].\\nTherapy response for thyroid remnant and metastatic lesions above the accepted lesion Chapter 3 58 AD was assessed using an optimum activity approach. This approach resulted in relatively high therapeutic 131 I activity (median, 10 GBq; range, 2-20 GBq) and most lesions, as expected, received an AD above the established threshold values. In our study, therapeutic activity was almost 4 times lower (median, 2.8 GBq; range, 1.1 -5.5 GBq), and the estimated lesion AD range extended to the lower lesion AD values. As a result, we observed a statistically significant dose-response relationship, confirming a higher calculated lesion AD of completely responding lesions than the incompletely responding lesions. Interestingly, for thyroid remnants we observed a complete lesion response of 89% which is in good agreement with a complete response of 91% found by Jentzen et al. [17], whereas for metastases our study showed a complete lesion response of 69% compared with 88%. These findings suggest that an optimized activity approach might be most beneficial in DTC patients presenting with metastatic disease.\\nUsing ROC curve analysis, we showed that for lesions larger than 0.15 mL, pretherapeutic 124 I PET/CT lesion dosimetry can be used as a prognostic tool to predict lesion-based 131 I therapy response. For these lesions, the optimal threshold value was 90 Gy for thyroid remnants and 40 Gy for metastases. These values are considerably lower than the accepted threshold values of 300 Gy and 85 Gy. However, it is important to note that these optimum lesion AD thresholds are defined as the values that give the maximum correct classification combining both sensitivity and specificity. In DTC patient management, a correct prediction of incompletely responding lesions is important. Consequently, for patient\\'s management decision making, higher AD threshold values may be preferred. Reliable lesion dosimetry requires accurate radioactivity quantification and volume estimation, which are affected by the finite spatial resolution of current nuclear medicine imaging equipment [28], in particular for the small lesion volumes often encountered in DTC patients. In addition, high-spatial-resolution images obtained by ultrasonography or CT are considered unreliable because of a lack of differentiation between thyroid tissue and hematoma on these modalities [1]. As a result, lesion AD calculations are considered unreliable for small lesions. Using an established PET-based thresholding method yielding reliable volume estimation for lesions larger than 0.80 mL, Jentzen et al. [17] were able to accurately calculate lesion AD for 24% and 27% of all analysed thyroid remnants and metastases, respectively. In our study, we used a more advanced segmentation technique allowing volume estimation down to the 124  I PET spatial resolution volume of 0.15 mL. Consequently, reliable lesion AD estimation was obtained in 38% of thyroid remnants and 40% of metastases. Despite the improved volume segmentation technique, for most lesions only the minimum lesion AD could be calculated. In the future, further developments in PET/MRI might contribute to additional improvements of the dosimetry in small-volume disease [29].\\nUsing voxel-based 3-dimensional dose distribution calculations, several studies have reported on the AD distribution heterogeneity within lesions [13,14]. In these studies, substantial variability in intra-tumour AD was observed, possibly resulting in underdos-ing of tumour subregions and ultimately therapy failure [13]. Although in our study correction for partial-volume effect was performed by means of the recovery coefficient, heterogeneity of the lesion AD distribution was not considered because most lesions included in our study were small compared with the 124 I PET spatial resolution.\\nA limitation of our study was its retrospective nature. However, a high concordance with other studies using 124 I likely confirms the validity of our results. In fact, to date, no prospective randomized study addressing the optimal activity approach has been published, and the optimal therapeutic activity is not established yet [1,2]. The results of our study indicate that pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/CT lesion dosimetry can be used as a prognostic tool to predict lesion response. Therefore, we would strongly advocate cooperative efforts to establish a multicenter prospective 124 I trial to confirm our findings.\\nThis study provides evidence of a statistically significant dose-response relationship assessed by means of pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/CT dosimetry in both thyroid remnants and metastases. This will be a clinically useful contribution in patient management.\\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges. Therefore, and solely to indicate this fact, this article is hereby marked \"advertisement\" in accordance with 18 USC section 1734. No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported. Supplemental materials total of 66 lesions were included. All images were reconstructed with (PGC on ) and without PGC correction (PGC off ) implemented on the PET/CT system. For the phantom measurements, sphere recovery coefficient (RC) values were determined and background uniformity was quantified using the coefficient-of-variation (COV). For the patient measurements, the impact of the PGC correction was assessed by calculating the percentage difference in lesion uptake and lesion absorbed dose.\\nPGC correction provided a lower COV of 14.5% compared to 17.6% for PGC off . Compared to the PGC off values, PGC on sphere RC values were systematically increased with approximately 2.5% for the largest spheres and up to 70% for the smallest spheres. However, even with PGC correction, the RC values were still 15-20% underestimated for the largest spheres. For the patient data, PGC correction resulted on average in a small but significant increase in 124 I uptake (P < 0.005) and lesion dose (P = 0.008) of approximately 3%. However, the percentage difference in lesion dose ranged from -19% to 50% showing that PGC correction had a variable and large impact on calculated lesion absorbed dose for a few single lesions.\\nPGC correction resulted in significant higher sphere RC values, 124 I lesion uptake and lesion dose and should be applied whenever available.\\nTotal thyroidectomy is the preferred surgical procedure in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) followed by radioiodine treatment 4-6 weeks after surgery [1]. In radioiodine treatment, therapeutic amounts of 131 I are administered for 1) eliminating local regional lymph node metastases and distant metastases (lesions) 2) ablation of possible thyroid remnant tissue, 3) elimination of potential residual microscopic tumour deposits [2]. The absorbed (radiation) dose delivered to lesions and thyroid remnants has been established as the most relevant quantity that correlates with lesion response [3][4][5]. In a theranostic approach, pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/CT dosimetry is considered the preferred methodology to assess absorbed dose to lesions in high-risk DTC patients and has been shown to provide prognostic information on lesion response [6].\\nCompared to the most commonly used PET radionuclide 18   I is not a pure positron emitter. Approximately half of the emitted positrons are in cascade with so-called prompt gamma photons having an energy of 603 keV. As this photon energy is close to the energy of the 511 keV annihilation photons, it falls within the energy window of current clinical PET systems, resulting in the detection of spurious coincidence events which are termed prompt gamma coincidence (PGC) events in reference to the literature [10] (Figure 4.1B). In addition, PGC events can also occur from the cascade of (scattered high-energy) emitted gamma photons following electron capture (EC).\\nPGC correction is mandatory to improve image quantification and image quality. It has been demonstrated [11] that the location of the PGC events are spread all over the PET field of view and produce higher artificial background level in the sinogram space. The latest generation PET/CT scanners use a single-scatter simulation correction approach that includes a scaling factor to match the model-based scatter contribution to the actual amount of scatter derived from the measured emission sinograms. The scaling factor is derived from sinogram tail fitting outside the patient body. As a consequence, in the presence of higher artificial sinogram background, the single-scatter simulation correction approach overestimates, for instance, the amount of scatter in the central part of the image [12,13] as well as produces a minor but measurable underestimation of approximately 10% in 124  I activity concentration in hot-spot imaging [14,15]. In recent years, several strategies for reducing or subtracting PGC events have been proposed for 124 I and have recently been summarized in a review article [12]. Sinogrambased subtraction of PGC events is a promising approach besides other techniques (energy window, kernel model, Monte Carlo approach). Basically, the prompt gamma contribution is estimated using the emission data in the radial extremities (tails) of the sinogram data outside the patient, where no source of radioactivity is present. Subtraction of a simple uniform background [16] or a linear or polynomial [17] fit to the tails of the sinogram have been proposed for 124 I. A method combining a scaled randoms estimate added to the simulated scatter distribution profile to match the tails of the sinogram has been patented [18] by Siemens and implemented on commercially available PET/CT and PET/MRI systems. In 124 I phantom measurements, the application of PGC correction approaches has been shown to result in both an improvement in image quality, such as background uniformity and lesion contrast recovery, and image quantitation measured by sphere recovery coefficient (RC) values [19,20]. However, the influence of the PGC correction approach on patient data and, in particular, its impact on lesion dosimetry in DTC patients has not been investigated yet. As in DTC patients 124 I uptake is restricted to small foci with negligible background radioactivity, the impact of the PGC correction approach may differ from standard phantom measurements. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the PGC correction method implemented on the Siemens mCT system. First, phantom measurements were performed using a typical clinical imaging protocol and a protocol with a high counting statistics to study the influence of the PGC correction technique on focal 124 I lesion uptake. Second, the impact of the PGC correction method on measured 124 I lesion uptake and calculated lesion absorbed dose was evaluated using 124 I PET/CT images from DTC patients.\\n\\nAll measurements were performed on a Biograph mCT PET/CT system (Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany). The system consisted of a 128-slice CT scanner (SOMATOM Definition AS) and a 21.8 cm axial field of view PET system equipped with lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) scintillation detectors allowing PET time-of-flight (ToF) reconstruction. PET acquisitions were performed with an energy window of 435-650 keV and a coincidence timing window of 4.1 ns.\\nFor the Biograph mCT PET/CT system, a PGC correction method is by default implemented in the PET reconstruction algorithm for radionuclides emitting prompt gammas such as \\nPhantom preparation Phantom measurements were performed using an adapted NEMA IEC body phantom consisting of a torso-shaped background compartment containing seven fillable spheres (diameter: 6.6, 9.7, 12.6, 15.1, 22.2, 28.0 and 37.0 mm) of which the largest sphere was placed centrally within the torso phantom. 124 I activity was determined with a calibrated dose calibrator (CRC-15R; Capintec) using a standardized measurement condition described elsewhere [14]. To simulate high focal 124 I lesion uptake and low background radioactivity typically encountered in DTC patients, all spheres were homogeneously filled with an aqueous 124 I solution. The sphere and background radioactivity concentrations were 33.81 kBq/mL and 0.045 kBq/mL, respectively, resulting in a signal-tobackground ratio of 750:1. In addition, the same phantom was prepared with a higher radioactivity background level (sphere and background radioactivity concentrations of 40.94 kBq/mL and 4.36 kBq/mL, respectively, yielding a signal-to-background ratio of 9.4:1).\\nBoth the low-and high-background radioactivity phantoms were scanned with a lowdose helical CT scan (120 kVp, 15 mAs) followed by a single-bed PET acquisition of 2 minutes corresponding to a typical PET acquisition time used in clinical routine whole body PET/CT imaging in DTC. These measurements are termed clinical phantom measurements. In addition, single-bed high counting statistics PET acquisitions of 60 minutes were performed for both phantoms and are referred to as high-statistics phantom measurements.\\nFor all phantom measurements, PET images were reconstructed both with (PGC on ) and without (PGC off ) the PGC correction approach using off-line PET reconstruction software (E7tools; Siemens). PET image reconstruction was performed with the default ToF-based OP-OSEM3D reconstruction algorithm supplied by the manufacturer using 2 iterations, 21 subsets, a 4 mm Gaussian filter and almost cuboid-shaped voxels of 2 × 2 × 2 mm 3 .\\nBackground quantitative accuracy and uniformity were determined for the highstatistics, high-background phantom measurement for PGC on and PGC off images. Background quantitative accuracy was calculated as the percentage difference in measured mean radioactivity concentration, determined from a circular region of interest (ROI) having a diameter of 18 cm shown in Figure 4.2, with respect to the prepared background radioactivity concentration. In addition, nine circular ROIs with a diameter of 4 cm were drawn as shown in Figure 4.2. For each ROI, the mean radioactivity concentration was determined. Background uniformity was assessed using the coefficient of variation (COV) which was calculated from the standard deviation (SD) and average value (µ) of the mean radioactivity concentration measured in the nine ROIs according to COV = SD/µ × 100%.\\nSphere RC were determined using three measures for the PET radioactivity concentration. First, the average activity concentration was measured in a 10 mm diameter spherical volume of interest (VOI), located in the center of each sphere and is referred to as peak activity concentration (C peak ). Second, the average activity concentration of a VOI, consisting of a 3D isocontour containing all voxels with an activity concentration equal to or higher than 70% of the maximum voxel value which was termed 70% threshold activity concentration (C 70% ), was assessed. Third, the maximum voxel value (C max ) was determined. To avoid bias in VOI position, all VOIs were drawn on the PGC on images and copied directly to the PGC off images. For the high-statistics phantom measurements, RC values were calculated by dividing the measured activity concentration (C max , C peak and C 70% ) by the true activity concentration. In addition, for the clinical phantom measurements, the percentage difference in activity concentration measured in the PGC on images was calculated relative to the PGC off images. Patient image acquisition and reconstruction PET/CT acquisition was performed 24 and 120 hours after 124 I administration. PET/CT images were performed from head to thigh in supine position with arms up. Low-dose helical CT acquisition (120 kVp, 15 mAs) was followed by whole body PET scanning using a PET acquisition time of 2 minutes per bed position.\\nPGC on and PGC off PET images were retrospectively reconstructed using identical reconstruction parameters as for the phantom image reconstructions.\\nEach identified iodine-avid lesion was categorized as either a thyroid remnant, a lymph node or a bone metastasis based on its localization. Similar to the phantom measurements, the three types of activity concentration measures (C max , C peak , C 70% ) were ascertained for each lesion for PGC on and PGC off images. For all activity concentration measures, the percentage difference in activity concentration measured in the PGC on images was calculated relative to the values derived from PGC off images. In addition, Bland-Altman plots were created, showing the percentage differences as a function of the lesion activity concentration.\\nThe impact of the PGC correction approach on the estimated lesion absorbed dose for 131 I was also investigated. Specifically, the peak 124 I activity concentration (C peak ) -as an example for an average activity concentration generally used in the estimation of the lesion absorbed dose -was used to calculate the projected of tissue at 24 h and 120 h. For each lesion, the lesion dose per administered activity (LDpA) of a standard 0.52 mL lesion volume was calculated in Gy/GBq using the methodology described by Jentzen et al. [21]. For each lesion, the percentage difference between PGC on and PGC off on the LDpA was determined.\\nFor the patient data, statistical significance testing for all percentage difference measures (C max , C peak , C 70% and LDpA) between PGC on and PGC off was performed in SPSS version 23 (IBM Corp.) To correct for the fact that a number of patients showed multiple lesions (repeated measurements), a linear mixed model was applied, using a compound symmetric covariant structure for the repeated measurements, where lesion type was included in the fixed part of the model. Values of P less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\\n\\nIn Figure 4.3 the center slice images of the high-statistics phantom measurements are shown. Without PGC correction, the background radioactivity appeared decreased in the central part of the image, which is especially apparent for the high-background configuration, resulting in an underestimation in measured background activity concentration of 55% and a COV of 17.6%. This effect was explained from the sinogram profiles corresponding to the phantom measurements shown in Figure 4.4. Without PGC correction, the scatter distribution profile did not match the tails of the total emission profile, resulting in an oversubtraction in the central part of the image. With the PGC correction approach, the superposition of the prompt gamma contribution to the estimated scatter distribution profile resulted in an improved scatter correction and background uniformity as can be observed from Figure 4.3 and a lower COV of 14.3%. However, background radioactivity concentration was still underestimated by 30%.  The sphere RC calculated from the high-statistics phantom measurements are presented in Figure 4.5. Compared to the PGC off values, PGC on sphere RC values were systematically increased with approximately 2.5% for the largest spheres up to 70% for the smallest spheres both for the measurements with low-and high-background radioactivity concentration. However, even with PGC correction, the RC values were still underestimated with 15-20% for the largest spheres. Similar results were found for the clinical phantom measurements of which the percentage differences between PGC on and PGC off are shown in Table 4.1. \\nIn total, 66 iodine-avid lesions were identified of which 37 were classified as thyroid remnants, 18 as lymph nodes and 11 as bone metastases. In Figure 4.6 the percentage difference in measured lesion activity concentration (C max , C peak and C 70% ) between the PGC on and PGC off images is shown for thyroid remnants, lymph nodes and bone lesions for both the 24 and 120 h acquisitions.\\nAs can be seen from Figure 4.6, the percentage difference in C max , C peak and C 70% between PGC on and PGC off is typically smaller than 5% for lesions showing high 124 I uptake (activity concentration >50 kBq/mL), whereas for low lesion uptake higher differences up to 350% are observed. These large differences between the two methods in this region can be associated with failures of the background subtraction if the PGC correction is not used. Although for the 24 h images the percentage difference between PGC on and PGC off was statistically significant for all measurements, the mean percentage difference was less than 3.3% (C max : 1.90%, P = 0.005; C peak : 3.29%, P < 0.001; C 70% : 2.26%, P = 0.001). In addition, for bone lesions significantly higher percentage differences in lesion activity concentration were observed than for remnants (P = 0.014) and lymph nodes (P = 0.012). For the 120 h images the lesion activity concentration was lower compared to the 24 h images, resulting in an increased distribution in percentage difference and no significant differences with respect to either PGC correction or lesion type. In Figure 4.7 the percentage difference in calculated 131 I LDpA between PGC on and PGC off using the standard volume of 0.52 mL is shown for thyroid remnants, lymph nodes and bone metastases as a function of the LDpA. PGC correction resulted in higher calculated LDpA for the majority of lesions (41/66), resulting in an increase of the mean LDpA of 3.1%, which proved to be statistically significant (P = 0.008). PGC correction did not result in statistically significant differences between the different lesion types. The impact of PGC correction on the LDpA was highest for low LDpA (< 50 Gy/GBq), resulting in a maximum percentage difference of 50% [range: -19% -50%]. \\nFor the application of personalized radioiodine therapy, accurate pre-therapeutic lesion absorbed dose calculation is essential for estimating the individual therapeutic activity to be administered. Consequently, errors in the predicted lesion absorbed dose calculation may result in under-or overdosing [1,22]. However, 124 I produces a considerable amount of PGC events, resulting in an underestimation of the measured activity concentration [12,13] and therefore in the absorbed dose estimation. Since the location of PGC events are spread all over the PET field of view [11] it is expected that the impact of PGC events on lesion quantification depends on the 124 I radioactivity distribution. As in DTC imaging the 124 I radioactivity distribution is limited to a few small foci showing high uptake in the absence of background radiation, the impact of the PGC effect is expected to be less important compared to antibody imaging in which lower lesion uptake is observed in combination with higher background radioactivity levels [13]. Indeed, in our study we found that on average PGC correction resulted only in a small increase in the calculated LDpA of 3.1%, which is considered negligible compared to other sources of uncertainties in the lesion dosimetry calculations (for instance, uncertainties in dose calibrator measurements, segmented lesion volume and kinetic model used to estimate the residence time). Nonetheless, for a few lesions with a LDpA lower than 50 Gy/GBq, differences up to 50% in the LDpA between PGC on and PGC off are observed. This demonstrates that for these lesions PGC correction is essential and should be applied whenever available.\\nFor the majority of lesions, PGC correction resulted in an increase of124 I lesion uptake (C max , C peak and C 70% ) lower than 5% for the lesions showing high uptake as shown in Figure 4.6. However, for lesions with low uptake (< 50 kBq/mL) larger differences in measured radioactivity concentration up to 350% were observed. This effect can be explained from the poor counting statistics of these low uptake lesions: in a low counts condition, possible errors in the sinogram tail fitting procedure are amplified if no PGC correction is used, resulting in erroneous scatter correction and more dramatic differences between PGC on and PGC off . Therefore, PGC correction is in particular of importance for lesions showing low 124 I uptake, such as bone metastases. In our study we found a significantly higher impact of PGC correction for bone lesions than for thyroid remnants and lymph nodes in the 24 h 124 I uptake. The observed impact of the PGC correction approach in the patient measurements was in good agreement with the phantom measurements. Overall, PGC resulted in a small increase in measured hot spot activity concentration of approximately 2-5%, corresponding to the improvement of PGC correction on 124 I RC values reported in literature [19]. However, both for the patient and phantom data relatively large differences between PGC on and PGC off were observed for hot spots with a low amount of total radioactivity, resulting in poor counting statistics as described previously. In phantom data, the largest differences were observed for the smallest spheres as shown in Table 4.1; for patient data we observed an increase in difference with decreasing lesion radioactivity concentration as shown in Figure 4.6. Therefore, we conclude that PGC correction is most important for small lesions showing low 124 I uptake.\\nIn the phantom measurements, PGC correction substantially decreased the amount of oversubtraction of the conventional scatter algorithm as reported in literature [12,13]. This resulted in an improvement of background uniformity as shown by the lower COV values (17.6% versus 14.3%) and systematically higher sphere RC as shown in Figure 4.5 and Table 4.1. However, PGC correction was not perfect as can be observed from some residual background inhomogeneity visible in Figure 4.3. Moreover, even with PGC correction the background radioactivity concentration and RC values of the largest spheres were still underestimated by 30% and 10-15%, respectively, in agreement with values previously reported by Wierts et al. [9]. In contrast to our results, other groups did not report a significant underestimation in measured RC values for 124 I compared to 18 F [19,20]. This discrepancy is possibly caused by an inaccurate 124 I calibration factor of the dose calibrator, which may have resulted in an under-or overestimation of the true 124 I activity concentration. As the low-energy X-ray radiation (27 keV) emitted by ple geometry, sample-specific dose calibrator settings are essential to perform accurate 124 I activity measurements [10,23].\\nIn phantom measurements, PGC correction resulted in significant higher sphere RC values in combination with improved background uniformity. In patients, PGC correction resulted in an overall small increase of 3% in 124 I uptake and LDpA. However, for a few lesions showing low LDpA (<50 Gy/GBq), large differences in calculated lesion dose up to 50% were observed, indicating that PGC correction may have an important impact in a personalized radioiodine approach and should be applied whenever available.

Near the radiofrequency surface coil an underestimation of less than 5% in radioactivity concentration was observed. Soft-tissue sphere recovery coefficients were determined using the NE-MA IEC body phantom. Recovery coefficients were systematically higher for 18 F compared to 124 I. In addition, the six spheres of the phantom were segmented using a PETbased iterative segmentation algorithm. For all 124 I measurements, the deviations in segmented lesion volume and mean radioactivity concentration relative to the actual values were smaller than 15% and 25%, respectively. The effect of MR-based attenuation correction (3-and 4-segment µ-maps) on bone lesion quantification was assessed by using radioactive spheres filled with a K 2 HPO 4 solution mimicking bone lesions. The 4-segment µ-map resulted in an underestimation of the imaged radioactivity concentration up to 15%, whereas the 3-segment µ-map resulted in an overestimation up to 10%. For twenty lesions identified in six patients, a comparison of 124 I PET/MRI to PET/CT was performed with respect to segmented lesion volume and radioactivity concentration. The interclass correlation coefficients showed excellent agreement in segmented lesion volume and radioactivity concentration (0.999 and 0.95, respectively). In conclusion, accurate quantitative 124 I PET/MRI with the aim of performing radioiodine pretherapeutic lesion dosimetry in differentiated thyroid cancer is feasible.\\nRadioiodine therapy, after total thyroidectomy, is the standard adjuvant therapy in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) [1]. The radiation absorbed dose delivered to thyroid remnants and lesions (lymph nodes or distant metastases) is considered the most relevant quantity that has been shown to correlate with treatment outcome [2]. In the last decades, several groups have investigated the use of 124 I PET(/CT) to assess the lesion absorbed dose delivered in radioiodine therapy [3,4]. In fact, 124 I PET/CT is considered the most accurate method for pre-therapeutic dosimetry assessment in DTC and has been shown to alter patient management [5] and to provide prognostic information on lesion response [6].\\nReliable lesion dosimetry requires accurate quantification of lesion volume and 124 I uptake at different time points. As a result of the limited soft-tissue contrast, the boundary of tumours and thyroid remnants can generally not be segmented clearly on CT. Therefore, lesion volume segmentation is commonly performed on PET images. However, due to the limited spatial resolution of PET, lesion volume determination, and therefore accurate lesion dosimetry, is only achieved in 25-40% of all iodine-avid lesions [2,6]. As a result of the superior soft-tissue contrast of MRI over CT, MRI may provide additional diagnostic information in DTC patients. Due to this superiority, Nagarajah et al. [7] concluded that PET/MRI can enhance diagnostic certainty for small lesions and improve pre-therapeutic lesion dosimetry in DTC. However, whereas CT-based PET attenuation correction is straightforward, MR-based attenuation correction is more challenging, in particular for bony structures [8,9]. Moreover, the presence of radiofrequency (RF) surface coils in the PET field of view (FOV) can degrade PET image quantification [10].\\nIn general, the quantitative performance of PET/MRI systems is assessed for 18 F as this is the most commonly used PET radionuclide in clinical practice and readily available. In contrast to \\n\\nPET/MRI measurements were performed on a 3 Tesla Biograph mMR system having a gradient system with a maximum amplitude of 45 mT/m and a maximum slew rate of 200 (T/m)/s (Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany, software version VB20P). PET images were reconstructed using the manufacturer\\'s 3D iterative ordinary Poisson ordered-subsets expectation maximization (OP-OSEM3D) reconstruction algorithm. Unless mentioned otherwise, the default manufacturer\\'s recommendations for image reconstruction were applied: 3 iterations and 21 subsets, cuboid-shaped voxels of 2.0 mm and a 4.0 mm Gaussian smoothing filter. Correction of 124 I prompt gamma coincidences was performed using the standard manufacturer\\'s reconstruction software [13].\\nFor attenuation and scatter correction in patients, in general a 4-segment (air, lung, fat and soft-tissue) attenuation map (µ-map) derived from a 3D Dixon-VIBE MR sequence was used. For head-neck imaging, the system provides an alternative 3-segment (air, soft-tissue and bone) µ-map, using an ultrashort echo-time (UTE) MR sequence. For quantitative PET phantom measurements a CT-based (Gemini TF PET/64-slice CT scanner; Philips) µ-map was used for PET attenuation and scatter correction [14].\\nAll phantom measurements were performed with 124 I-sodium iodide ( 124 I-NaI) and compared to 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG). Measurement of the absolute 124 I activity is crucial for dosimetry quantification and requires a standardized procedure [4,15]. Radioactivity measurement of syringes used for phantom preparation was performed using a dose calibrator (Isomed 2010; MED, Dresden) that was validated against a high-purity germanium semi-conductor detector (GR1018; Canberra Industries, Connecticut).\\nThe PET calibration factor was determined using a cylindrical phantom (internal diameter 14 cm, internal length 20 cm) homogeneously filled with radioactivity in aqueous solution. Single-bed PET acquisitions of 7 minutes were performed using a radioactivity concentration of 6.5 kBq/mL for 18 F, corresponding to the FDG PET/CT standard operating procedures for quality control of the European association of nuclear medicine (EANM) [16]. As in clinical practice, lower amounts of 124 I are administered compared to 18 F, an activity concentration of 1.70 kBq/mL was used for 124 I. As the CF measurement uncertainty is increased for lower counting statistics, PET acquisition times of 93 120 minutes were used to obtain similar counting statistics as for the 18 F measurements, taking into account both the lower activity concentration and lower positron yield of 124 I. For both 18 F and 124 I, measurements were firstly performed without RF coils as a reference.\\nTo investigate the influence of attenuation of two commercially available Biograph mMR PET-compatible RF coils used for head-neck imaging, the phantom measurements were repeated twice: the first time with the cylindrical phantom placed inside the rigid 16-channel head-neck RF coil, the second time with the small and flexible 4-channel special purpose surface RF coil placed on top of the cylindrical phantom.\\nFor all measurements with and without RF coils, the PET calibration factor CF was determined as the mean radioactivity concentration a mean measured in a central cylindrical volume of interest (VOI) (diameter 10 cm, length 15 cm), divided by the prepared or true radioactivity concentration a true :\\n𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 = 𝑎𝑎 mean 𝑎𝑎 true .\\nEq. 1\\nThe standard deviation (SD) of the CF was determined as the standard deviation of the CF calculated for the individual transversal slices using a circular region of interest with a diameter of 10 cm. Furthermore, for each axial plane five circular regions of interest (ROIs) with a radius of 1.0 cm were drawn as shown in Figure 5.1a. For each ROI and plane number, the ratio of the mean radioactivity concentration measured with RF coil relative to the reference measurement without RF coil was calculated. From these calculated radioactivity concentration ratios, the mean and standard deviation were determined. The 95% uncertainty interval of the radioactivity concentration ratio per plane was calculated as the mean ratio ± 2 standard deviations.\\nSoft-tissue sphere recovery coefficients (RCs) were determined using the NEMA IEC body phantom. This phantom consists of a torso-shaped background compartment containing six fillable spheres (diameter: 10, 13, 17, 22, 28 and 37 mm) and a cylindrical insert filled with polystyrene (internal diameter 44.5 mm). Corresponding to the EANM standard operating procedures for quality control of FDG PET/CT [16], all spheres were homogeneously filled with an aqueous solution having a radioactivity concentration of 13.8 kBq/mL for 18 F and 14.0 kBq/mL for 124 I. For both radionuclides, measurements were performed without radioactivity present in the background compartment (cold background). In addition, measurements were performed with radioactivity present in the background compartment (hot background), corresponding to a prepared sphereto-background ratio of 10:1. For accurate assessment of the RC, single-bed PET high counting statistic acquisitions of 30 minutes for The mean and maximum radioactivity concentrations were determined by drawing spherical VOIs having a diameter corresponding to the actual sphere diameter. The mean (maximum) recovery coefficients RC were calculated by dividing the measured mean (maximum) sphere radioactivity concentration C meas by the prepared or true sphere radioactivity concentration C true :\\n𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶 = 𝐶𝐶 meas 𝐶𝐶 true .\\nEq. 2\\nSimulation of bone lesions was performed with a bone-tissue phantom by filling the six spheres of the NEMA IEC body phantom with a K 2 HPO 4 solution mixed with 18 F or124 I.\\nFor both radionuclides, a high and low concentration of K 2 HPO 4 , simulating compact and cancellous bone tissue, was used: 0.84 g/mL and 0.42 g/mL, resulting in CT numbers of 780 HU and 490 HU, respectively. For the high and low concentrations of K 2 HPO 4 , the radioactivity concentration and acquisition time (within parentheses) was 9.3 kBq/mL (30 min) and 18.8 kBq/mL (15 min) for 18 F and 27.9 kBq/mL (20 min) and 14.9 kBq/mL (40 min) for 124 I, respectively. The radioactivity concentrations and acquisition times were chosen to obtain similar high counting statistics for the low and high K 2 HPO 4 concentration measurements for each radionuclide separately, partly compensating for the lower positron yield of 124 I compared to 18 F. PET images were reconstructed using three different µ-maps. First, reference PET images were reconstructed using an original CT-based µ-map of the bone-tissue phantom. Second, to simulate the 4-segment MR-based attenuation correction, in which bone is (incorrectly) classified as soft-tissue, the linear attenuation coefficient of the bony spheres in the original CT-based µ-map was set to that of water. PET images were reconstructed using this adapted µ-map. Third, the 3-segment MR-based attenuation correction was simulated by replacing the linear attenuation correction of the bony spheres with a fixed linear attenuation coefficient of 0.151 cm -1\\n. PET reconstructions were performed using the adapted µ-map.\\nSpherical VOIs corresponding to the actual sphere dimensions were drawn for all spheres. The percentage deviation in mean radioactivity concentration measured in the reconstructed images using the 3-or 4-segment MR-based µ-map relative to the reference PET images was calculated.\\nFor reliable lesion dosimetry, accurate volume segmentation of the lesion and its radioactivity concentration are required. In a recent a homogeneous radioactivity concentration [17]. Accounting for the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) spatial resolution of the PET images and background radioactivity level, the segmentation algorithm determines the optimum threshold value for lesion delineation. Besides lesion volume, the method calculates the lesion mean radioactivity concentration, corrected for partial volume effects [17].\\nThe described volume segmentation method requires the effective spatial resolution of the PET images. Therefore, the spatial resolution was measured using a line-source phantom consisting of a cylindrical phantom (diameter 20 cm, length 30 cm) filled with water in which a plastic line source was placed (internal diameter 0.9 mm, length 25 cm). Tangential and radial resolution were measured at 1, 10 and 20 cm distance to the centre of the FOV. Axial resolution was measured at the centre of the FOV and at 9 cm offset. The radioactivity concentration of the line sources was 10 MBq/mL for 18 F and 8\\nMBq/mL for 124 I using an acquisition time of 30 minutes and 60 minutes. Except for a 2.0 mm Gaussian smoothing filter, default PET reconstruction settings were used.\\nFor each direction (tangential, radial, axial), the FWHM spatial resolution was calculated by fitting a Gaussian curve through the radioactivity profile of the reconstructed line source using Matlab (The MathWorks Inc). The average spatial resolution was calculated from the spatial resolution values measured at different distances from the centre of the FOV for each direction. Finally, the effective spatial resolution was calculated as the mean value of the average spatial resolution of the three directions.\\nThe accuracy of the described PET-based iterative segmentation method was investigated for the soft-tissue phantom measurements. To this end, the iterative segmentation method was applied to all spheres using an in-house developed Matlab script. As the segmentation method uses the determined effective spatial resolution, the images were reconstructed with the same reconstruction settings as the spatial resolution measurements. The percentage deviation in segmented lesion volume and mean radioactivity concentration, corrected for partial volume effect, relative to the actual sphere volume and radioactivity concentration were determined. PET/CT scans were acquired from head to thigh with arms up, using a low-dose CT scan (120 kVp, 15 mAs) and a PET emission time of 2 minutes/bed position typically used in clinical routine whole body PET/CT examinations. In contrast, PET/MRI scans were restricted to the head-neck region with arms down. To achieve optimum PET image quality, PET acquisition was simultaneously performed for the duration of the MRI examinations, which contained a T 1 -weighted VIBE sequence (echo time 2.46 ms, repetition time 6.18 ms, flip angle 12°), resulting in long PET acquisition time of 20-30 minutes/bed position. PET image reconstructions were performed with the OP-OSEM3D reconstruction algorithm using 3 iterations, 24 subsets for PET/CT and 3 iterations, 21 subsets for PET/MRI. PET/CT and PET/MRI images had almost cuboid-shaped voxels of 2 mm. For both systems, correction for prompt gamma coincidences was applied for 124 I by the manufacturer [13]. As the intrinsic PET spatial resolution of the PET/CT system is slightly lower than the PET/MRI system (5.5 mm versus 5.0 mm at zero smoothing level), different levels of Gaussian smoothing were applied (PET/CT 3.0 mm and PET/MRI 4.0 mm) to achieve almost identical effective spatial resolution (6.3 mm FWHM). As the five DTC patients did not show any bone lesions, additionally one neuro-endocrine patient was included, who was scanned with \\n\\n\\nThe calibration factors of 18 F and 124 I without RF coils were 1.00 ± 0.02 and 0.88 ± 0.02, respectively. For both the rigid head-neck coil ( 18 F: 1.02 ± 0.02, 124 I: 0.89 ± 0.02) and the flexible RF surface coil ( 18 F: 0.98 ± 0.02, 124 I: 0.88 ± 0.02) no substantial deviations of the calibration factor with respect to the reference measurement were observed.\\nFigure 5.1 shows the ratio of the mean radioactivity concentration measurements with RF coil to the reference measurement without RF coil as a function of the axial plane number. As the 18 F and 124 I measurements showed comparable results, only the 97 124 I measurements are shown. 18 F data are shown in the supplemental material. As can be seen in Figure 5.1a, for the head-neck RF coil no notable deviations of the mean radioactivity concentration with respect to the 95% uncertainty interval were observed for all circular ROIs, indicating that the automatic detection and attenuation correction for the head-neck RF coil worked properly. Figure 5.1b shows at planes 35 to 60, corresponding to the location of the RF surface coil, a small decrease of 5% in mean radioactivity concentration ratio derived from the ROI situated in close proximity to the RF surface coil (ROI1). This decrease is explained by the fact that the PET attenuation caused by the RF surface coil was not taken into account in the attenuation correction during PET image reconstruction.   F reconstructed images showed highly comparable results (supplemental material). Attenuation correction performed on the standard 4-segment (without bone) MR-based µ-map resulted in an underestimation up to 15% of the mean radioactivity concentration, due to the too low linear attenuation coefficient assigned to the bone lesion simulating spheres. This underestimation increased with increasing density and sphere diameter. In contrast, the 3segment (with bone) MR-based µ-map yielded an overestimation up to 10% indicating that a too high linear attenuation correction is assigned to the spheres. This overestimation increased with decreasing density and increasing sphere diameter.\\n\\nThe effective spatial resolutions of      The ICC values revealed an excellent agreement between PET/MRI and PET/CT quantification for both lesion volume (0.999; 95%-confidence interval: [0.999 -1.00]) and average radioactivity concentration (0.95; 95%-confidence interval [0.87 -0.98]). However, percentage deviations larger than 25% in segmented lesion volume (radioactivity con-Chapter 5 102 centration) were observed for about 50% (25%) of the lesions, in particular for the small lesions (detailed information in supplemental material).\\n\\nTo perform reliable 124 I PET/MRI lesion dosimetry in DTC patients, accurate assessment of lesion uptake at different time points and lesion volume is required. In previous studies, a systematic underestimation of approximately 10% in measured 124 I radioactivity concentration has been reported compared to 18 F [4,15,18]. This underestimation has in literature been ascribed to overestimation of the conventionally applied scatter correction algorithms resulting in an oversubtraction in the central part of the image [19]. To overcome this problem, a prompt-gamma correction method for 124 I, using a scaled random estimate matching the tails of the prompt sinogram [13], is by default implemented on the Siemens Biograph mMR and Biograph mCT systems. However, for both the calibration factor and soft-tissue sphere RC measurements, we still observe an underestimation of 10-12% in measured radioactivity concentration compared to 18 F. Although Preylowski et al. [20] showed that implementation of the prompt-gamma correction method did not result in a notable increase in 124 I RC values for the Biograph mCT system, they reported similar RC values for 124 I and 18 F, in contrast to our results.\\nThis discrepancy cannot be completely resolved, but is most likely related to an imprecise 124 I calibration factor of the dose calibrator [4,15,21].\\nFor high resolution MR imaging of the head-neck region, the use of dedicated headneck and RF surface coils is essential in clinical practice. Such coils cause attenuation of the PET signal, resulting in significant underestimation of the measured radioactivity concentration up to 19% [10,22]. For rigid, stationary coils, such as the head-neck coil, a CT-based µ-map of the coil is automatically integrated in the PET image reconstruction algorithm upon connection and placement of the coil on the PET/MRI system. Although for flexible surface coils various techniques for attenuation correction have been proposed [22,23], all Biograph mMR surface coils, including the small and flexible 4channel RF coil used in this study, are optimized for PET-transparency by stripping the coils from as much of its PET attenuating materials as possible. Our results show that the effect of both investigated RF coils on the PET quantification was locally smaller than 5% for both 18 F and 124 I.\\nThe classification of bone as soft-tissue in the standard 4-segment µ-map resulted in an increasing underestimation of the measured radioactivity concentration up to 15% with increasing sphere density and diameter, in agreement with values reported in literature [8,24]. In contrast, for the UTE 3-segment µ-map, in which bone is assigned a fixed linear attenuation coefficient of 0.151 cm -1\\n, an increasing overestimation up to 10% was found. A similar overestimation of bone using UTE-based µ-maps has also been reported in literature [25,26]. Recently, a novel MR-based attenuation correction technique using bone mask pairs for major bones has shown to improve PET/MR quantification in bone [24,27]. Although the quantification differences for bone-tissues are relatively small compared to other uncertainties in the dosimetry calculations (for instance, uncertainties in dose calibrator measurements, kinetic model used to estimate residence time, segmented lesion volume and mean radioactivity concentration), the effect of MR-based attenuation correction on 124 I lesion dosimetry of bone lesions requires further investigation. The used lesion segmentation technique requires the PET spatial resolution to account for regional spill-out and spill-in effects. Therefore, the effective PET spatial image resolution was assessed using line sources in water for both 18  PET/CT spatial resolution measurements [4,18,20]. In contrast, using point sources in air, Soderlund et al. [12] reported equal 124 I and 18 F PET spatial resolution values for the Biograph mMR. This discrepancy is explained by the difference in positron range in measurement setup between a point source in water and air, shown by Kemerink et al. [28].\\nIn the presence of background radioactivity, smaller lesion volumes were segmented than without background radioactivity for both 124 I and 18 F. This is explained by the effect of the cold lesion walls which has been shown to result in a wall-related reduction of the optimum threshold value with increasing background [29]. As a result of this effect, the applied segmentation threshold value is overestimated leading to an underestimation of lesion volume, in agreement with our observations. Despite this effect, the error in segmented lesion volume was less than 15% for 124 I. For 18 F a relatively large underestimation of 47% in segmented lesion volume was shown for the smallest sphere that is probably caused by a combination of voxel discretization and the cold-wall effect. As this effect depends on the ratio of the thickness of the cold wall to the spatial resolution, this effect is more pronounced for 18 F than 124 I. Although the used segmentation method used the average lesion activity concentration assuming a spherically shaped lesion with a homogeneous radioactivity concentration, accurate lesion segmentation was shown in clinical scenarios [17].\\nFor the 124 I and 18 F phantom measurements, the errors in partial volume corrected lesion activity concentration were less than 25%, with the exception of the smallest sphere for 18 F. Moreover, for 124 I the mean radioactivity concentration was systematically lower compared to 18 F, in agreement with the measured calibration factor and soft-tissue sphere RC. After correction for this effect, by dividing the measured radioactivity concentration by the calibration factor, the errors in the partial volume corrected lesion activity concentration were less than 15%. These errors are relatively small compared to other uncertainties in the dosimetry calculations mentioned previously. Despite an excellent agreement in 124 I PET/MRI and PET/CT segmented lesion vol- 104 respectively), relatively large deviations were observed for some lesions as shown in Figure 5.6. This was caused by the low counting statistics of the PET/CT images, in particular for small lesions and lesions with low radioactivity concentration, and its noise was further enhanced by the 2 mm voxel size to avoid the volume discretization effect. Moreover, the differences in the PET emission times between PET/MRI and PET/CT was a limitation in the direct comparison of 124 I lesion quantification of the different modalities. This is reflected in two lymph nodes showing very low 124 I uptake. They could only be identified on the PET/MRI images as a result of the long emission time of the PET/MRI acquisition, indicating that an emission time of only two minutes used in whole body PET/CT imaging may not be sufficient for identifying small lesions showing low 124 I uptake. However, the PET emission times used reflected the clinical practice. Specifically, in PET/CT, whole body PET examinations are generally performed (with arms up) using an emission time per bed of only a few minutes, whereas, in PET/MRI, single bed positions of the head-neck region are typically performed (with arms down) as a result of the long acquisition times of the various MRI sequences used. As the PET acquisition can be performed simultaneously with MRI, the clinical PET acquisition time is matched to the time of the MRI examination to achieve the best PET image quality. Therefore, the quantitative comparison presented in this study provides a realistic representation of the use of 124 I PET/MRI in clinical routine for DTC. Another shortcoming of this study was the small amount of included patients and analysed lesions. Due to the absence of bone lesions in DTC patients, four 124 I-MIBG positive bone lesions were analysed to study the effect of PET/MRI quantification for bone lesions. As the volume and radioactivity concentration of these lesions correspond to the values typically encountered in bone lesions in DTC patients, the comparison is considered to be representative for DTC patients.\\nFor the rigid head-neck RF coil, no decrease in radioactivity concentration resulting from coil attenuation was observed. Near the RF surface coil a small underestimation of less than 5% in radioactivity concentration was observed as a result of RF coil attenuation. For bone simulating lesions, MR-based attenuation correction using the 4-segment µmap resulted in an underestimation of the mean radioactivity concentration up to 15%, whereas the use to the 3-segment µ-map showed an overestimation up to 10%. In a clinical setting, an excellent agreement between PET/MRI and PET/CT segmented lesion volume and mean 124 I radioactivity concentration was observed. Therefore, we conclude that accurate quantitative 124 I PET/MR imaging with the aim of performing radioiodine pre-therapeutic lesion dosimetry in DTC is feasible.  \\nIn nuclear medicine departments radioactive isotopes are regularly used for diagnostic and therapeutic treatment purposes. Therefore, it is important to assess the risk of exposure to the associated ionizing radiation, not only for the patients themselves, but also for other patients, visitors and staff members. To protect people outside treatment rooms, it is often necessary to place additional shielding material in the walls. In addition, sensitive measuring equipment such as gamma cameras may require shielding from radiation sources outside the room for optimal performance. Although it is rather expensive, lead shielding is commonly used for this purpose. It is therefore important to carefully assess the placement of shielding to achieve an optimal design that is safe, cost effective, and in line with the applicable legislation.\\nThe attenuation coefficients for γ-radiation of the materials used for radiation protection purposes in practice are readily available [1,2]. However, calculations based solely on linear attenuation coefficients generally underestimate the radiation levels behind shielding barriers, because they assume narrow beam geometry. Buildup factors to account for the contribution of radiation scattered in the shielding barrier are becoming readily available for the materials and photon energies required [1,3]. However, even when using a broad beam geometry, this does not take into account that shielding is often applied up to a certain height; typically 2.0-2.5 meters.\\nFor X-ray applications limited data is available on the contribution of radiation that travels over the protective barrier and scatters from the ceiling [4][5][6]. Recently Martin et al. [5] provided estimates of the ceiling scatter contribution for typical diagnostic X-ray facilities, by summing the contribution of experimentally determined scatter fractions. They concluded that it is important to take ceiling scatter into account for the shielding of e.g., CT scanners. However, such data is not readily available for the γ-radiation commonly encountered in nuclear medicine. To our knowledge, only one study is available involving ceiling scatter of γ-radiation. This study focused on several specific shielding scenarios for a PET/CT room [7]. γ-Radiation differs in some aspects from the radiation generated in X-ray tubes used for diagnostic X-ray imaging. Typically, it has a higher photon energy and a discrete energy spectrum, whereas X-ray tubes emit photons in a broad continuous range of energies. Also, X-ray tubes have a collimated beam that is scattered by the patient, whereas in nuclear medicine the source (the patient) emits ionizing radiation in all directions. Although the basic shielding physics is the same, these considerations make shielding of nuclear medicine rooms different from the shielding of radiology rooms.\\nThis paper aims to facilitate the assessment of the contribution of the ceiling scatter to the radiation dose in nuclear medicine applications. This will allow for improved shielding designs of nuclear medicine rooms. For this purpose we performed Monte Carlo simulations for three isotopes that are commonly used in nuclear medicine: 99m Tc (conventional nuclear medicine), 131 I (radionuclide therapy) and  F). Therefore, our results can be translated to isotopes emitting photons with other energies, and will be useful for almost all isotopes commonly used in nuclear medicine.\\n\\nWe used the Gate Monte Carlo toolkit v7.0 [8], which is based on Geant4 v9.6.3 [9,10] to simulate trajectories of photons emitted by the radioactive isotopes 99m Tc, 131 I and 18 F. For the electromagnetic physics we used the Penelope models. The Penelope low energy physics models of the Geant4 version used in this work (v9.6.p03), make use of the photon interaction cross sections of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\\'s Evaluated Photon Data Library [11]. This dedicated low energy physics model was preferred to the standard EM models, since the latter are parameterized instead of relying on evaluated data libraries. TABLE 6.1. Properties of the three radioactive isotopes and the photons emitted with a yield > 0.03. For each isotope the highest yield photon energy was included in the simulations to simplify the interpretation of the results (bold rows). Data were taken from the NuDat database [12] (half-life and yield) and the NIST XCOM database [2] (half-value layer narrow beam). Buildup factors for the broad beam transmission were taken from Shimizu et al. [3].\\nhalf-life photons yield > 0.03 half-value layer (d0. The sources were simulated as point sources free in air, i.e. no self-absorption. The energy and yield of the photons emitted by these isotopes, with a yield > 0.03 are listed in Table 6.1. For each of the isotopes only the photon energy with the highest yield and penetration depth was included in the simulations (bold rows in Table 6.1). Although this neglects the contribution of some low yield photon energies, it allows for the translation of our results to other photon energies without the complexity of multiple photon energies per isotope.\\nWe chose to use a simplified but realistic room design (see Figure 6.1), consisting of a 30 cm thick concrete floor and ceiling in a space that was 6.0 m wide, 14.0 m long and has a maximum ceiling height of 5.0 m. In the middle of the 14.0 m long side the lead shielding barrier was placed, ranging over the entire width of the space and dividing it into two rooms of 7.0 m length. The thickness of the lead barrier was chosen to be 2.0 mm for 99m Tc and 8.0 mm for 131 I and 18 F, which correspond to realistic values for adequate shielding in clinical practice. The radiation source was placed in the left room at a distance of 3.0 m from the barrier in the middle of the room at a height of 1.0 m above the floor, which is the approximate height of a patient lying on a bed. The ceiling height was varied between 3.0-5.0 m in 0.5 m steps. For each ceiling height, simulations were performed for different barrier heights. These were chosen to be 1.8, 2.2, 2.6, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5 and 5.0 m. The maximum height of the barrier used was the ceiling height; i.e. shielding up to the ceiling. In order to differentiate the contributions of the direct and scattered radiation, we ran the simulations twice for all geometries: once to measure the total radiation dose outside the room, and once to measure only the contribution of the ceiling scatter. The latter was achieved by setting the barrier properties such that it absorbs all incoming radiation. From these two simulations we could assess the contribution of ceiling scatter to the total radiation dose. In total, this resulted in 165 separate simulations: 3 radionuclides, 5 ceiling heights, 4-8 shielding heights and total radiation dose/ceiling scatter only. A fixed number of 40 million photons per simulation was used. This number of photons was chosen after a series of test runs, as it yields sufficient precision (of the order of a few percent in the determined kerma or better) while keeping the computation time reasonable, i.e. around 1 day.\\nMonte Carlo simulations of ceiling scatter in nuclear medicine:\\n99m Tc,\\nF Chapter 6\\n116\\nTo quantify the dose rate behind the protective barrier, we chose to measure the air kerma in vertical and horizontal planes. Air kerma is calculated from the simulations by summing the contribution of all the individual photons i:\\n𝐾𝐾 air = ∑ 𝜇𝜇 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 (𝐸𝐸 𝑖𝑖 )𝐸𝐸 𝑖𝑖 𝜌𝜌 cos 𝛼𝛼 𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖 , Eq. 1\\nwhere K air is the air kerma (in Gy) and µ tr is the energy transfer coefficient of air (m -1 ) [13], which depends on the photon energy E i (J). The density of air is given by ρ (kg/m 3 ), and α i is the angle between the photon path and the plane in which the air kerma is calculated. Reported air kerma values are averaged over 1.0 m (horizontal) by 0,5 m (vertical) rectangles.\\nNarrow beam transmission calculations assume that the photon is lost at every interaction. The contribution of scattered photons is neglected in this approach. In a broad beam approach, buildup factors are used to correct for the contribution of scattered photons. We compared the results of our simulations to both narrow and broad beam transmission calculations. For the broad beam calculations, we used the buildup factors for lead provided by Shimizu et al. [3].\\n\\nThe top row of Figure 6.2 shows the total air kerma at a distance of 1.0 m behind the lead wall, at a height of 1.5 m, for different geometries and three different isotopes. This height was chosen as a typical height of the organs most sensitive to radiation for a person standing at that location. The bottom row shows the ratio of the kerma due to ceiling scatter (scatter air kerma) and the total air kerma. As expected, we found that, for a given ceiling height, the total air kerma behind the barrier decreases as the barrier height is increased. This decrease is the result of a reduction of the ceiling scatter and is more pronounced for lower ceiling heights. For each curve the total air kerma is lowest when shielding is placed all the way up to the ceiling and the air kerma behind the shielding is solely due to transmission of radiation through the shielding.\\nThe contribution of the ceiling scatter also depends strongly on the photon energy. For 99m Tc between 50-100% of the radiation outside the room is due to ceiling scatter; whereas for 131 I this is between 5% and 45% and for 18 F it is below 20%. \\nWe also investigated total air kerma as a function of the distance to the barrier. Figure 6.3 shows the results for a ceiling of 4.0 m. Interestingly, maximum dose levels were not always found directly behind the protective barrier. For 99m Tc, the maximum radiation dose was found about 1-2 m behind the barrier. This decreases slightly for 131 I, and for 18 F the maximum is directly behind the barrier.\\nMonte Carlo simulations of ceiling scatter in nuclear medicine: 99m Tc, \\nF Chapter 6 118\\nWe compared the results of our simulations to narrow and broad beam transmission calculations. To our knowledge, no measurement data are available that could be compared to our simulations. Figure 6.4 shows the effective transmission of the shielding (ratio of air kerma with and without shielding) as a function of the shielding thickness in units of the half value layer, for all three isotopes. Simulations were performed for a typical thickness of the lead shielding (2 mm for 99m Tc and 8.0 mm for 131 I and 18 F). The transmission as determined from our simulations, excluding the ceiling scatter, shows good agreement with that of the broad beam transmission calculations. For 99m Tc, the simulations are 31% below the calculations, for 131 I and 18 F they are 12% and 2.4% higher respectively. The larger deviation for 99m Tc is likely due to the larger uncertainty for this isotope. The lower transmission of the 141 keV photons results in a smaller number of photons detected in the Monte Carlo simulations resulting in a larger uncertainty. Additionally, the relatively large buildup factor for 99m Tc is likely associated with a lower accuracy. The effective transmission, including ceiling scatter, for different shielding thicknesses can be estimated by adding the ceiling scatter contribution from the simulations (the difference between the two points) to the broad beam transmission curve. This is a valid approach, as the ceiling scatter is independent of the shielding thickness. This effective transmission is shown by the dotted lines in Figure 6.4.\\nWe find that the difference in the expected transmission between a normal broad beam calculation, and one that includes ceiling scatter can be substantial when the shielding thickness becomes large with respect to the half-value layer. It is also interesting that the curves for the different isotopes are rather similar; for all three isotopes the ceiling scatter contribution reaches 50% of the total radiation dose when about four half-value layers of shielding are used. FIGURE 6.4. Comparison of calculated narrow beam transmission (solid line), broad beam transmission (dashed line) and the transmission results of our Monte Carlo simulations plotted as a function of shielding thickness expressed in units of the half-value layer (first half value layer for broad beam transmission, see Table 6.1). Simulation results are for a ceiling height of 3.5 m and a barrier height of 2.2 m (black dots) two points are plotted for each isotope: including ceiling scatter (higher point) and excluding ceiling scatter (lower point). The dotted line shows the broad beam transmission including ceiling scatter as determined from the simulations.\\nFrom these results it is clear that there may be many cases in which it is important to take the contribution of ceiling scatter into account. To facilitate the calculation of shielding requirements for new nuclear medicine rooms, we present the air kerma due to ceiling scatter as found in our simulations, with a source at a distance of 3 meters from the wall, in Table 6.2. It should be noted that in our simulations no wall is present above the lead shielding. In practice this will result in a conservative estimate (overestimation) of the ceiling scatter, as a wall will typically offer at least some degree of shielding.\\nMonte Carlo simulations of ceiling scatter in nuclear medicine:\\n99m Tc, \\nF Chapter 6 120\\n- - 0.1 - - - - 0.1 - - - - 0.3 5.0 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\nThe optimal shielding of a nuclear medicine room depends on many aspects, such as the isotopes and amount of radioactivity used, room dimensions, and the occupancy of neighboring rooms. Typically, stand-alone SPECT and gamma-cameras do not require a lot of radiation shielding. The dose rates of the (diagnostic) amounts of 99m Tc used are typically rather low, except in cases with a high patient throughput, high doses of radioactivity such as encountered in post radionuclide therapy examinations, and/or small examination rooms. However, radioactive sources (such as radioactive patients) outside the scanner room can be problematic when calibrating such a system. In contrast, for PET cameras and radionuclide therapy rooms a substantial amount of shielding is often required, and the amount of lead necessary can be rather costly. Applying shielding close to the ceiling (or above a dropped ceiling) can be especially expensive and cumbersome, as ventilation and plumbing pipes are often located there. It is therefore important to determine, as accurately as possible, how much shielding is necessary and up to which height it is required. Irrespective of the isotope, we find a clear dependence of the relative importance of ceiling scatter on the room and shielding geometry. This dependence shows a qualitatively similar dependence on ceiling height and barrier height as is seen for X-ray modalities [5]. Higher barriers reduce the radiation dose, as expected, and this effect is more pronounced for lower ceiling heights. This can be expected, as the relative decrease in area of the gap between the ceiling and top of the barrier is larger for lower ceiling heights. For a fixed barrier height, higher ceilings result in lower radiation levels from ceiling scatter. This reduction with height does not simply follow a 1/r 2 behavior, because the exposed area of the ceiling also increases with increasing ceiling height.\\nHowever, there are also important differences compared to X-ray modalities: the range of photon energies is typically much larger, and the photons are mono-energetic. As a result, the differences between low-and high photon-energy applications are much larger. In practice, for high photon-energy applications, such as PET, it is typically more effective to use relatively low and thick shielding, while for lower energy applications relatively thin but higher shielding may be beneficial. This can be understood by our comparison of the results of our simulations to broad beam transmission curves. These show that the relative importance of ceiling scatter strongly depends on the thickness of the applied shielding as measured in units of the half-value layer. In high energy applications, typically only a few half-value layers of shielding are used, while in low energy applications even 2 mm of lead is equivalent to 5 half-value layers or more. Therefore, the radiation traveling through the wall is already effectively shielded and ceiling scatter is the dominant contribution. To determine shielding requirements in a practical situation, an estimate of the relative contribution of ceiling scatter can be made using the data in Figure 6.2 to 6.4. For more detailed calculations the ceiling scatter contribution found in Table 6.2 can be added to the contribution from radiation travelling through the shielding (used in broad beam transmission factors available in the literature), as these two contributions are independent of each other.\\nInterestingly, we found that, due to the ceiling scatter contribution, the maximum radiation dose might not be found directly behind the shielding barrier. The point of maximum radiation dose can be located more than a meter behind the shielding barrier, depending on the relative contribution of the ceiling scatter. Potentially, a person working behind a desk could be sitting exactly in the dose maximum. Therefore, measuring radiation levels directly behind shielded walls, as typically done to check whether sufficient shielding is present, might not be the most accurate approach in cases with a relatively high contribution of ceiling scatter.\\nIn our current simulations we only took the most relevant photon energy into account for each isotope. While this facilitates interpretation of the results, in practice, of course, all photons need to be taken into account. 131 I, for instance, emits 637 keV photons with a yield of 7.2% in addition to the 365 keV photons modelled in our simulations. When more than several half-value layers of shielding are used, the contribution of these photons will become dominant and should thus be taken into consideration. In addition, we have modelled the radiation sources as a point source free-in-air. In case patients are the source of radiation, a correction for self-absorption can be performed. Finally, we have placed the source at a distance of 3 meters from the shielding, but in practice this distance will typically vary. For sources located closer to the shielding, the relative contribution of the ceiling scatter will decrease, whereas for sources located further away it will increase [7].\\nMonte Carlo simulations of ceiling scatter in nuclear medicine:\\n99m Tc,\\nF Chapter 6 122\\nCeiling scatter can be a dominant factor in the radiation does outside shielded nuclear medicine rooms. The contribution of ceiling scatter, compared to that of ionizing radiation traveling through shielding in the wall, depends mostly on room geometry (ceiling and shielding height) and the thickness of the shielding as measured in units of the halfvalue layer. When more than about 4-5 half-value layers of shielding are used, ceiling scatter becomes the dominant factor and should be taken into account.\\nThe contribution of ceiling scatter to the radiation dose as determined from our Monte Carlo simulations will facilitate the design of more cost-effective and safe solutions for future nuclear medicine rooms. F 125 Chapter 7\\n\\nThe overall aim of this thesis was to improve radiation dose assessment in radioiodine treatment in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). As described in Chapter 2, advanced tailored dosimetry has been reported feasible in clinical practice and both instrumentation and dosimetric software are still evolving at high pace. For DTC, the concept of performing personalized radioiodine treatment, in which pre-therapeutic blood and/or lesion absorbed dose calculations are considered in the decision-making of the 131 I activity to be administered in therapy, is described in the latest guidelines on DTC [1][2][3]. Although the application of pre-therapeutic lesion absorbed dose assessment has been reported to change patient management in 25%-50% of DTC patients [4,5], the use of pre-therapeutic dosimetry is not recommended in these guidelines. In clinical practice, empirically determined fixed amounts of radioiodine activity, based on disease characteristics and patient age, are usually still administered. This is explained from a lack of supporting evidence from randomized controlled trials, long standing professional traditions, personal expertise and, last but not least, reimbursement issues [6]. In addition, reliable lesion dosimetry requires accurate quantification of lesion volume and radioiodine uptake at multiple time points which is time consuming, not patient friendly and technically challenging due to the finite spatial resolution and sensitivity of nuclear medicine imaging equipment. Finally, with the current treatment, in which fixed therapeutic amounts of 131 I are administered following total thyroidectomy, the prognosis of DTC is in general excellent and 10-year relative survival rates of 0.98 for papillary and 0.92 for follicular disease have been reported [7].\\nAccording to the European union council directive 2013 [8] a tailored dosimetry approach is required for all medical radiotherapeutic purposes (including radionuclide therapy) and target volumes should be individually planned, taking into account that doses to non-target volumes and tissues must be as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). This requirement is supported by the fact that the use of empirically fixed amounts of 131 I has been reported to result in the risk of under-or overdosing [2,9,10].\\nIndeed, radioiodine treatment has been shown to result in adverse effects such as salivary gland dysfunction, transient gonadal dysfunction and second primary malignancies and the prevalence and severity of these effects correlate with increasing therapeutic amounts of 131 I activity [11]. Recent studies have reported no statistically significant differences in ablation success rate between low (1.1 -1.85 GBq) and high (3.7 -5.5 GBq) amounts of administered 131 I in low-to intermediate-risk patients [12][13][14][15]. Even though long-term data with respect to the chances of local recurrence and the effect of adjuvant therapy are not yet available, post-surgical radioiodine treatment is no longer routinely indicated for the majority of low-and intermediate-risk DTC patients according to the latest recommendations of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) [1]. This standpoint, however, is debated by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) [16] and not endorsed in the Dutch national DTC guidelines in which the use of a low amount of 1.1 GBq 131 I activity for remnant ablation in low-risk DTC patients is recommended [17]. At the moment, there is widespread consensus that the use of pretherapeutic personalized dosimetry for radioiodine treatment is not recommended for low-risk DTC patients and a personalized radioiodine treatment approach only has potential benefit for high-risk patients showing distant metastases [1]. In these patients, radioiodine therapy success is decreased and multiple high-dose (3.7 -7.4 GBq) radioiodine treatments, are often required [2]. However, in a fixed therapeutic activity approach, the maximum activity that can safely be administered is limited. In fact, it has been demonstrated that in more than 90% of patients much higher activities can be administered, indicating that the majority of high-risk patients are potentially undertreated using a fixed activity approach [18]. Indeed, in a retrospective study described in Chapter 3 we found that lesions that showed complete response to radioiodine therapy received a statistically significant higher lesion absorbed dose compared to the lesions showing no or incomplete response. Using a fixed activity approach, we found a response rate of 69% for metastatic lesions, whereas Jentzen et al. [19] reported a 88% response rate using a 124 I PET/CT-based personalized activity approach which resulted in higher administered 131 I activities. These findings indicate that a personalized dosimetry approach using 124 I PET/CT facilitates lesion dose escalation and may result in improved patient outcome in high-risk DTC patients.\\nAs described in Chapter 2, the clinical application of performing pre-therapeutic 124 I PET dosimetry in DTC faces several challenges and limitations which result in uncertainties in the lesion absorbed dose calculations (inter alia: uncertainties in lesion radioiodine uptake quantification, lesion volume determination, radioiodine residence time and 124 I related quantification errors). Despite these uncertainties, we showed in Chapter 3 that the lesion absorbed dose, calculated from pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/CT measurements, provided prognostic information with respect to complete lesion response. However, the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves presented in Figure 3.2 of Chapter 3 show moderate area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.68 and 0.73 for all remnants and metastases, respectively, which may be increased with improved 124 I PET quantitative performance and lesion volumetry, resulting in smaller lesion absorbed dose uncertainties.\\nAccurate quantification of radioiodine uptake is affected by the finite spatial resolution of current nuclear medicine imaging equipment. Even for 124 I PET, which is by various groups considered to be the preferred imaging modality for the application of radioiodine dosimetry in DTC [5,20,21], the spatial resolution is currently limited to 5-7 mm as shown in Chapter 5. As a consequence, activity recovery is substantially degraded even for relatively large lesion volumes up to 5 cm 3 as shown in the recovery coefficient (RC) curves presented in Chapters 4 & 5, meaning that for smaller lesions sophisticated partial volume correction techniques are required. Moreover, due to the limited spatial resolution relevant small-scale activity inhomogeneities within a tissue will be unknown.\\nIn particular, Jentzen et al. [22] reported a discrepancy in the calculated salivary gland absorbed dose, which is considered to be an organ at risk in radioiodine therapy, and clinical observation of glandular side effects which they described to result from a radioiodine distribution on microscopic scale. In addition, for lesions showing low 124 I uptake, lesion quantification can be affected by the low counting statistics of short whole body PET examinations. In Chapter 5 we observed percentage deviations in measured 124 I lesion radioactivity concentration larger than 25% for a quarter of all 124 I-avid lesions measured with PET/CT and PET/MRI.\\nThis was caused by the low counting statistics of the whole body PET/CT images which were acquired for only 2 minutes per bed position. In contrast, for PET/MRI, PET acquisition was restricted to the head-neck region and performed simultaneously with the MRI examinations resulting in long PET acquisition times of 20-30 minutes. These findings indicate that short PET emission times result in substantial uncertainties in calculated lesion absorbed dose.\\nAnother major challenge in lesion absorbed dose assessment in DTC is the accurate determination of lesion volume which is essential for reliable lesion dosimetry. Due to the limited soft-tissue contrast, the boundary of tumours and thyroid remnants can generally not be segmented clearly on high-resolution anatomical CT or ultrasound images and lesion volumetry based on these imaging modalities is considered unreliable [2]. Therefore, in clinical practice, lesion volume segmentation is commonly performed on PET images. However, the majority of lesions encountered in DTC are very small with respect to the PET spatial resolution. In fact, using a sophisticated iterative lesion volume segmentation method which facilitates accurate volume determination for lesions with a diameter down to the PET spatial resolution and correcting for partial volume effects, we found that lesion volume could only be reliably determined in 40% of all lesions as described in Chapter 3.\\nIn addition, lesion absorbed dose assessment requires knowledge of the lesion radioiodine uptake as a function of time. The medical internal radiation dose (MIRD) scheme [23], advises to use one or two data points taken at a fraction of the effective radiopharmaceutical half-life T e , one near T e and two other data points taken at approximately 3 T e and 5 T e , meaning a total of 4-5 data points. For radioiodine therapy in DTC patients, Jentzen et al. demonstrated that the radioiodine residence time, defined as the total number of radioactive disintegrations in the lesion per administered unit activity, can in good approximation be determined from the 24 and 96 hour radioiodine uptake after administration using a single exponential fit through both measurements and assuming linear uptake during the first 8 hours, as shown in Figure 1.3 of Chapter 1 [24]. Although this simplified 24-96 h approach reduces the number of required sample points and therefore facilitates the application of performing pre-therapeutic 124 I lesion dosimetry in a clinical setting, deviations up to 38% with respect to the 5 point sample approach for lesions showing a low radioiodine uptake were reported.\\nCompared to 18 F, 124 I is not an ideal radionuclide for quantitative PET imaging. First of all, the high amount of low-energy X-rays emitted by 124 I are prone to self-absorption within the sample, for instance a syringe or vial. Since this self-absorption depends on sample geometry and dose calibrators are rather sensitive to low-energy X-ray radiation, sample specific dose calibrator settings are essential to perform accurate 124 I activity measurements [25]. Moreover, with a positron yield of 22.5%, the count rate sensitivity is over 4 times lower compared to 18 F. In addition, due to the high end-point energy of the emitted positrons, the PET spatial resolution in soft-tissue is degraded by 0.5 -1.0 mm as shown in Table 5.1 of Chapter 5. Furthermore, 124 I is not a pure positron emitter and approximately half of the emitted positrons are in cascade with a 603 keV prompt gamma photon resulting in the detection of spurious coincidences termed prompt gamma coincidence (PGC) events. These PGC events are spread all over the PET field of view (FOV) producing higher artificial background levels in the PET sinograms. As current PET scatter correction is performed using a model-based scatter distribution which is scaled to the sinogram tails outside the patient body, the increased background levels lead to an overestimation of the amount of scatter in the central part of the image resulting in an underestimation of the 124 I activity concentration as clearly demonstrated in Figure 4.2 of Chapter 4.\\n\\nIn Chapter 4 it was shown in phantom measurements that PGC correction, based on a scaled randoms estimate, substantially reduced the amount of underestimation of the 124 I activity concentration present in the background compartment of the phantom. In addition, a systematic increase in sphere RCs were observed ranging from 3-5% for the largest spheres up to 70% for the smallest spheres, indicating the importance of PGC correction. However, even with PGC correction a systematic underestimation in 124 I RC values was observed, indicating that the PGC correction method was not perfect. In patient measurements, PGC correction resulted in an increase in measured 124 I lesion activity concentration for the majority of lesions at 24h after 124 I administration. Although this increase proved to be statistically significant, the mean percentage deviation was less than 3%. More importantly, PGC correction resulted only in a very small increase in calculated lesion dose per administered activity (LDpA) (mean percentage difference 3.1%), and thus lesion absorbed dose, which is considered negligible compared to the other sources of uncertainty in the lesion dosimetry calculations as described previously. Nonetheless, for lesions showing only low 124 I uptake (<50 kBq/mL), large deviations in calculated LDpA up to 50% were observed. This indicates that PGC correction may have an important impact in a personalized dosimetry approach of DTC patients and should be applied if available.\\nAs a result of the superior soft-tissue contrast of MRI over CT in head-neck imaging, 124 I PET/MRI is an attractive alternative to PET/CT for the application of 124 I lesion absorbed dose assessment in DTC patients. In Chapter 5 the quantitative performance evaluation of 124 I PET/MRI with the aim of performing lesion dosimetry in DTC was described. The effect of radiofrequency (RF) coil attenuation on PET image quantification was less than 5% and considered negligible for two commercially available PET-compatible RF coils used for head-neck imaging. However, coil-related attenuation artefacts resulting in significant underestimation of the measured radioactivity concentration up to 19% have been reported in literature [26,27]. Therefore, PET-compatibility of RF coils must be confirmed for reliable dosimetry measurements. In addition, using the default MR-based attenuation correction of the manufacturer in which bone is classified as soft-tissue, phantom measurements of bone-simulating tissue showed an increasing underestimation in measured 124 I radioactivity concentration up to 15% with increasing bone density and size. Alternatively, for head-neck imaging, the PET/MRI system facilitates PET attenuation correction in which bone, detected on a ultra-short echo-time (UTE) MR sequence, is assigned a fixed linear attenuation coefficient. In contrast to the default MR-based attenuation correction method, this approach resulted in an overestimation in measured 124 I radioactivity concentration. These findings are in line with values reported in literature [28][29][30][31] \\nBesides the application of lesion absorbed dose assessment in radionuclide therapy, dosimetry is also required to calculate the radiation dose to personnel, the general population or the environment. This is in particular true for radionuclide therapy using large amounts of radioactivity. As a consequence, protective measures such as the placement of shielding materials in the walls of radionuclide treatment rooms are often required to fulfil legal requirements. Optimal cost-effective design of radionuclide treatment rooms requires a tailored dosimetry approach in which room size, occupation level of adjacent areas, radionuclide characteristics and total annual amount of radioactivity used has to be considered. The application of conservative analytic shielding calculations in general requires the use of numerous simplifications (for instance a radioactive point source geometry free in air and neglecting self-absorption of radiation in the patient\\'s body) often resulting in an overestimation of the required shielding thickness or height. In Chapter 6, it was shown that Monte Carlo simulations can successfully be used to determine the contribution of radiation traveling over the applied shielding material and scattering of the ceiling to the total radiation dose outside the treatment room. As expected, the contribution of ceiling scatter to the total radiation dose, depends largely on room geometry and shielding thickness and height. In fact, when more than 4-5 half-value layers of shielding are used, ceiling scatter may become a dominant factor and should be considered. This analysis shows that tailored Monte Carlo-based dosimetry calculations can be used for cost-effective improved shielding designs in nuclear medicine facilities.\\nIn recent years, important developments in nuclear medicine instrumentation have been introduced. Apart from hybrid PET/MRI systems capable of performing simultaneous acquisition of high-quality PET and MR images, digital PET/CT systems with improved time-of-flight capability, spatial resolution and count rate sensitivity have become commercially available. Combined with novel advanced resolution recovery, PGC correction PET reconstruction algorithms, these developments will strongly improve quantitative PET performance. In addition, advanced user-friendly dosimetry software packages may facilitate the widespread use of personalized radionuclide therapy in a clinical setting. In DTC, the application of a personalized radioiodine approach based on pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/CT or PET/MRI dosimetry may result in an improvement of patient outcome, in particular for high-risk patients showing advanced disease. However, for a global adoption of pre-therapeutic personalized dosimetry in radioiodine treatment, randomized controlled studies showing a clear benefit of such approach with respect to the currently standard fixed activity approach will be essential.\\nTailored dosimetry approaches are increasingly used to calculate the radiation dose to patients, personnel, general population or environment. In DTC patients, the application of personalized dosimetry, based on pre-therapeutic 124 I PET imaging, can be used as a prognostic tool to predict lesion response to radioiodine therapy. Furthermore, the use of a personalized dosimetry approach facilitates optimization of the therapeutic amount of radioiodine to be administered which may improve patient outcome and reduce adverse effects to therapy. The introduction of new developments in 124 I PET imaging, such as hybrid PET/MRI and PET reconstruction algorithms including PGC correction, will result in an improvement of the lesion absorbed dose estimation. However, for a widespread adoption of the application of personalized dosimetry in DTC, randomized controlled studies showing a benefit of such approach are essential. The aim of this thesis was to improve radiation dose assessment in radioiodine treatment in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), both for the application of personalized patient treatment using quantitative 124 I PET imaging and radiation protection of personnel and the general population. With respect to patient management, the application of lesion dosimetry, based on pre-therapeutic 124 I PET, may provide valuable prognostic information and allow for a personalized radioiodine treatment approach. A personalized radioiodine treatment approach facilitates dose escalation and may improve patient outcome, which is in particular important for high-risk DTC patients. In addition, for patients presenting with lesions showing high radioiodine uptake, a personalized treatment approach may yield lower amounts of radioiodine used in therapy and result in less adverse effects.\\nFrom the perspective of radiation protection, accurate dosimetry allows for improved shielding designs in radionuclide therapy facilities that are safe, cost effective and in line with the applicable legislation.\\nIn Chapter 1 a general introduction on the application of radioiodine therapy in DTC is provided. In addition, the concept of performing personalized pre-therapeutic lesion absorbed dose assessment for radioiodine therapy in DTC, based on hybrid PET/CT and PET/MRI imaging, is described. Finally, the use of Monte Carlo-based dosimetry, aimed at radiation protection of visitors and personnel in radioiodine treatment, is discussed.\\nChapter 2 provides a review of the literature with respect to personalized dosimetry approaches and relevant developments in molecular nuclear therapy. It is shown that advanced personalized dosimetry in radionuclide therapy is feasible and that developments in nuclear medicine imaging instrumentation and dosimetric software are evolving at a high pace. However, personalized procedures developed so far differ in approach and sophistication, and standard operating procedures necessary for a widespread implementation are only scarcely available.\\nIn Chapter 3, the dose-response relationship of radioiodine therapy using a fixedactivity approach is retrospectively investigated for DTC by means of lesion absorbed dose assessment based on 124 I PET/CT examinations that were performed prior to the therapy. Using a novel segmentation technique, allowing accurate lesion volume estimation down to the 124 I PET spatial resolution volume, we found that lesions showing complete lesion response to the radioiodine therapy received a statistically significant higher lesion absorbed dose compared to lesions showing no or incomplete lesion response. In addition, receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/CT lesion dosimetry can be used as a prognostic tool to predict lesion response to radioiodine therapy.\\nAccurate 124 I PET quantification, and thus lesion dose assessment, is affected by the detected prompt gamma coincidence (PGC) events of 124 I. In recent years, different techniques for PGC correction have been investigated and have become commercially available. In Chapter 4 we investigated the impact of a PGC correction technique on 124 I PET/CT quantification for both phantom and patient data. In addition, the effect of PGC 140 correction on calculated lesion absorbed dose was determined. In phantom measurements, PGC correction substantially improved background uniformity. In addition, PGC correction resulted in significant higher sphere recovery coefficient values, measured 124 I lesion uptake and calculated absorbed lesion dose and should be applied whenever available.\\nDue to the superior soft-tissue contrast of MRI compared to CT for head-neck imaging, 124 I PET/MRI may become increasingly important in DTC patients. However, compared to PET/CT, in which a relatively straightforward CT-based PET attenuation correction is applied, quantitative PET/MRI is more challenging. In Chapter 5 the quantitative performance of 124 I PET/MRI, aimed at performing lesion dosimetry in DTC patients, was investigated. Using phantom measurements, it was shown that the 124 I radioactivity concentration was underestimated by 12%. The influence of radiofrequency coil attenuation on 124 I quantification was less than 5% and considered negligible. For bonesimulating lesions, standard MR-based attenuation correction, in which bone tissue is ignored, resulted in an additional underestimation of the 124 I activity concentration. This underestimation increased with increasing lesion density and diameter. In a clinical setting, an excellent agreement between PET/MRI and PET/CT segmented lesion volume and mean 124 I radioactivity concentration was observed for DTC patients. Therefore, we concluded that accurate lesion dose assessment in DTC patients is feasible based on 124 I PET/MR imaging. Besides lesion dose assessment in patients, radiation dose calculations are also important in the shielding design of nuclear medicine therapy facilities. In practice, the shielding in walls is often limited to a height lower than the actual ceiling height. Consequently, radiation traveling over the shielding material and scattered by the ceiling may result in an important contribution to the radiation dose outside the radionuclide treatment facility. Using Monte Carlo simulations, in Chapter 6 this contribution of ceiling scattered radiation to the total radiation dose was investigated. As expected, we found that the shielding required for the primary radiation, measured in half-value layers, is an important factor in the relative contribution of ceiling scatter. In fact, when more than about four half-value layers of shielding are used, ceiling scatter becomes the dominant factor and should be taken into account in the shielding design. The results of this study will facilitate improvements in the design of radionuclide treatment facilities.\\nIn Chapter 7, the results of the previous chapters are discussed in a broader perspective. Besides the current role of tailored dosimetry in DTC also the potential benefits of this approach are discussed together with the technical challenges and novel developments on 124 I PET-based lesion dosimetry.\\nHet doel van deze thesis is het verbeteren van stralingsdosisberekeningen van patiënten met gedifferentieerd schildklierkanker die behandeling met radioactief jodium ondergaan. Dit betreft zowel de toepassing van een gepersonaliseerde patiënt behandeling waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van kwantitatieve 124 I PET imaging, als de bescherming tegen ioniserende straling van personeel en leden van de bevolking. Voor wat betreft patiënt management kan de toepassing van laesie dosimetrie, gebaseerd op pre-therapeutische 124 I PET imaging, waardevolle prognostische informatie verschaffen en gepersonaliseerde therapie met radioactief jodium mogelijk maken. Een gepersonaliseerde therapie benadering faciliteert dosis escalatie en kan de kans op succesvolle therapie verbeteren, hetgeen in het bijzonder van belang is voor hoog-risico schildklierkanker patiënten. Bovendien zou gepersonaliseerde jodiumtherapie, voor patiënten met laesies die veel radioactief jodium opnemen, kunnen resulteren in het gebruik van lagere hoeveelheden radioactief jodium en een afname van de nadelige effecten ten gevolge van de therapie.\\nVanuit het perspectief van stralingsbescherming kan nauwkeurige dosimetrie leiden tot verbeteringen van afschermingsmaatregelen in radionuclide therapiekamers welke veilig, kosteneffectief en in overeenstemming met de vigerende wet-en regelgeving zijn.\\nIn Hoofdstuk 1 wordt een algemene introductie met betrekking tot de toepassing van radioactief jodiumtherapie in gedifferentieerd schildklierkanker gegeven. Daarnaast wordt het concept van gepersonaliseerde, pre-therapeutische stralingsdosisberekeningen aan laesies, gebaseerd op hybride PET/CT en PET/MRI beeldvorming, beschreven voor jodiumtherapie bij gedifferentieerd schildklierkanker. Tot slot wordt het gebruik van Monte Carlo gebaseerde dosimetrie bij jodiumtherapie, ten behoeve van stralingsbescherming van personeel en leden van de bevolking, beschreven.\\nHoofdstuk 2 verschaft een uiteenzetting van de literatuur betreffende gepersonaliseerde dosimetrie methodieken en relevante ontwikkelingen in moleculaire nucleaire therapie. De mogelijkheden van het gebruik van geavanceerde, gepersonaliseerde dosimetrie in radionuclidentherapie zijn aangetoond en ontwikkelingen op het gebied van beeldvormende instrumentatie en dosimetrie software binnen de nucleaire geneeskunde vinden op hoog tempo plaats. De tot dusver ontwikkelde gepersonaliseerde procedures verschillen echter in benadering en complexiteit en standaard werkinstructies noodzakelijk voor een wijdverbreide implementatie zijn slechts in geringe mate beschikbaar.\\nIn Hoofdstuk 3 is de dosis-response relatie van jodiumtherapie ten behoeve van schildklierkanker onderzocht in een retrospectieve studie middels berekening van de stralingsdosis welke door laesies is ontvangen tijdens therapie. De dosisberekening is hierbij uitgevoerd op basis van 124 I PET/CT onderzoeken uitgevoerd voorafgaand aan de jodiumtherapie. Door gebruik te maken van een nieuwe segmentatiemethode, waarmee een nauwkeurige schatting van  I PET/MR imaging. Naast de bepaling van de stralingsdosis ontvangen door laesies, speelt dosimetrie ook een belangrijke rol in het afschermingsontwerp van radionuclidentherapieruimtes. In praktijk is de afscherming vaak aangebracht tot een hoogte lager dan de hoogte van het plafond. Hierdoor kan straling, welke over de afscherming gaat, verstrooid worden aan het plafond en een belangrijke bijdrage leveren aan de totale stralingsdosis buiten de radionuclidentherapieruimte. Op basis van Monte Carlo simulaties is in Hoofdstuk 6 de bijdrage van deze verstrooide straling ten opzichte van de totale stralingsdosis onderzocht. Zoals verwacht vonden we dat de dikte van de afscherming, nodig voor de afscherming van de primaire straling, uitgedrukt in het aantal halveringsdiktes, een belangrijke factor is voor de relatieve bijdrage van de straling verstrooid aan het plafond. Voor situaties waarin de dikte van de afscherming meer dan ongeveer vier halveringsdiktes bedraagt, kan straling verstrooid aan het plafond zelfs de dominante factor worden en dient deze dus meegenomen te worden in het ontwerp van de afscherming. De resultaten van deze studie maken de optimalisatie van het ontwerp van afscherming van radionuclidentherapieruimtes mogelijk.\\nIn Hoofdstuk 7 worden de resultaten van de voorafgaande hoofdstukken bediscussieerd in een breder perspectief. Naast de huidige rol van gepersonaliseerde dosimetrie in gedifferentieerd schildklierkanker worden tevens de mogelijke voordelen van deze benadering besproken samen met de technische uitdagingen en nieuwe ontwikkelingen op het gebied van Relevance for society Thyroid cancer is the most frequent endocrine malignancy having a yearly incidence of 3.1 and 9.3 per 100,000 for men and females, respectively. The last decades, the yearly incidence of thyroid cancer has shown a significant increase worldwide. Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), in which specific iodine uptake is preserved, comprises the vast majority of all thyroid cancers. When adequate treatment, including radioiodine therapy, is given, the prognosis of DTC is in general excellent for patients showing no distant metastases.\\nIn clinical practice, empirically determined fixed amounts of radioiodine are generally administered in radioiodine therapy in DTC, according to Dutch and international guidelines. In this approach, the amount of radioiodine to be administered is based on disease and patient characteristics. However, it has been shown that radioiodine uptake of iodine-avid lesions, and thus the lesion absorbed radiation dose, varies highly, not only between different patients but also between different lesions within the same patient. In addition, radioiodine treatment in DTC patients may result in adverse effects such as salivary gland dysfunction, transient gonadal dysfunction and secondary primary malignancies which have been shown to correlate with increasing radioiodine activity. As a consequence, the fixed activity radioiodine therapy approach may result in an under-or overdosing of patients. Indeed, for patients presenting with distant metastases, chances of successful therapy are decreased substantially. In addition, recurrence rate after initial treatment is relatively high and subsequent radioiodine therapy is needed in a considerable number of patients.\\nAs an alternative to the fixed-activity approach, pre-therapeutic dosimetry assessment can be used to facilitate personalized radioiodine treatment. In fact, according to the 2013 council directive of the European Union, a tailored dosimetry approach is required for all medical radiotherapeutic purposes, including radionuclide therapy. In this thesis we have shown in a retrospective study that a personalized radioiodine approach, using pre-therapeutic 124  I PET/CT based lesion dosimetry, provided prognostic information with respect to lesion response. Therefore, we conclude that a personalized dosimetry approach may be useful in DTC patient management, in particular for highrisk patients.\\nThe results of our studies with respect to 124 I PET based lesion dosimetry are of interest for radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians, endocrinologists, medical physicists, radiation protection experts and, most importantly, in the future also for patients suffering from DTC. The application of a tailored dosimetry approach in DTC may result in optimized and individualized radioiodine treatment. On the one hand, this would facili-tate lesion dose escalation and may improve patient outcome, which is in particular important in high-risk DTC patients presenting with distant metastases. On the other hand, for patients with lesions showing high radioiodine uptake, a personalized treatment approach may yield lower amounts of radioiodine used in therapy and result in less adverse effects.\\nThe results of our study to the contribution of ceiling scatter to the total radiation dose outside nuclear medicine treatment rooms are of interest for radiation protection officers, radiation protection experts and medical physicists and allow for improved shielding designs in nuclear medicine departments which are save, cost effective, and in line with the applicable legislation.\\nThe overall aim of this thesis was to improve radiation dose assessment in radioiodine treatment in DTC, both for the application of personalized patient treatment using quantitative 124 I PET imaging and radiation protection of personnel and the general population. To this end, first we provided an overview of currently used personalized dosimetry approaches and relevant developments in the field of molecular nuclear therapy. Moreover, we investigated the quantitative characteristics of PET/MRI with respect to 124 I PET lesion dosimetry in radioiodine therapy in DTC patients. Using both phantom and patient data, we showed that accurate 124 I PET/MRI quantification with the aim of performing pre-therapeutic lesion dosimetry in DTC patients is feasible in a clinical setting. As PET/MRI offers a superior soft-tissue contrast in the head-neck region compared to PET/CT, in the future, PET/MRI may become increasingly important for specific clinical tasks (such as children with DTC) or, at least, in combination with PET/CT a modality of choice for 124 I PET imaging in DTC patients. In addition, we investigated the impact of a novel sinogram-based prompt gamma coincidence correction technique on 124 I PET uptake quantification and on the lesion absorbed dose estimation in DTC. It was shown that prompt gamma coincidence correction may have a substantial impact in a personalized radioiodine approach, in particular for small lesions showing low 124 I uptake, and should be applied whenever available.\\nSo far, the results described in this thesis have been reported in one review article and three original research articles that were published in peer-reviewed scientific journals in the field of nuclear medicine or medical physics. In addition, results were presented on the international congress of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine.\\nAlthough dosimetry in radionuclide therapy is still greatly in development, advanced tailored dosimetry based on pre-therapeutic imaging has been reported feasible in recent years. Important developments in nuclear medicine instrumentation improving (quantitative) image quality such as hybrid SPECT/CT, PET/CT and PET/MRI systems, time-of-flight PET, digital PET detectors and novel advanced reconstruction algorithms using sophisticated physics models have become commercially available. In addition, the development of dosimetric software programs capable of performing personalized dosimetry is still evolving at high pace.\\nImplementation of a pre-therapeutic 124 I PET dosimetry approach in a clinical setting is limited as a result of a lack of supporting evidence from randomized controlled trials, long standing professional traditions, personal expertise and reimbursement issues. Furthermore, reliable lesion dosimetry is technically challenging, time consuming and expensive.\\nIn this thesis we have shown in a retrospective study that lesions showing complete lesion response to radioiodine therapy received a statistically significant higher lesion absorbed dose, assessed from pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/CT, compared to lesions showing no or incomplete lesion response. Moreover, pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/CT based lesion dosimetry provided prognostic information with respect to lesion response to radioiodine treatment, indicating that a personalized dosimetry approach may be useful in patient management and improve treatment outcome.\\nThe research described in this thesis was performed in a close collaboration with the university hospital of Essen and the university hospital RWTH Aachen. In addition, for one study we collaborated with the university hospital of Essen, and the university of Twente. Hybrid PET/MRI systems have recently become commercially available. Although to date no studies have been published in which the added value of 124 I PET/MRI imaging in DTC patients was investigated for a large number of patients, this thesis demonstrated the feasibility of performing pre-therapeutic 124 I PET/MRI based lesion dosimetry. As PET/MRI offers a superior soft-tissue contrast in the head-neck region compared to PET/CT, PET/MRI may provide important added value over PET/CT imaging and may become a modality of choice for 124 I PET imaging in DTC patients in the future.\\nThe concept of performing personalized radioiodine treatment in DTC patients, in which radiation absorbed dose calculations are considered in the decision-making of the amount therapeutic radioiodine to be administered in therapy, is described in the latest guidelines of both the American Thyroid Association and the European Associa-tion of Nuclear Medicine. Moreover, the application of pre-therapeutic lesion absorbed dose assessment has been reported to result in a change in patient management for a substantial number of DTC patients. However, personalized radioiodine treatment based on pre-therapeutic dosimetry calculations is not recommended in the latest guidelines on radioiodine therapy in DTC as the biologic effectiveness of dosimetryguided approaches has not been proven yet. In fact, to date, prospective randomized controlled studies addressing the optimal activity approach are lacking. Based on our results that showed that 124 I PET-based lesion dosimetry provides prognostic information on lesion response, we would strongly advocate cooperative efforts to establish a multicentre prospective 124 I trial to investigate the potential benefits of a personalized radioiodine approach over the empirically determined fixed-activity approach.\\nNa jaren hard werken is het einde van mijn promotietraject dan eindelijk in zicht. Gedurende deze periode heb ik proefondervindelijk ervaren dat mijn keuze om na mijn studie natuurkunde eerst in opleiding tot klinisch fysicus te gaan, om vervolgens alsnog te promoveren naast een fulltime baan als klinisch fysicus, mij voor een enorme uitdaging heeft gesteld. Tijdens mijn promotieonderzoek heb ik ontzettend veel steun en hulp gehad van veel mensen waarvan ik een paar mensen in het bijzonder wil bedanken.\\nAllereerst wil ik mijn promotoren Prof. dr. Mottaghy en Prof. dr. ir. Backes en copromotor Dr. Kemerink bedanken voor de manier waarop ik zelf richting heb mogen geven aan mijn promotieonderzoek en jullie kritische blik en constructieve feedback hierop. Hierdoor heb ik mij de laatste jaren kunnen ontwikkelen als wetenschapper op het gebied van de klinische fysica binnen de (nucleair geneeskundige) beeldvorming en radionuclidentherapie.\\nBeste Felix, direct na mijn opleiding in Groningen heb jij mij als klinisch fysicus aangenomen op de voormalige afdeling nucleaire geneeskunde van het MUMC+. Ik herinner mij hierbij nog goed dat in de gestelde vacature gevraagd werd naar een geregistreerd en gepromoveerd klinisch fysicus NG met minimaal 5 jaar werkervaring als klinisch fysicus. Ondanks het feit dat op het moment dat wij elkaar voor het eerst ontmoetten (dit was de dag nadat het Nederlands elftal de WK finale van Spanje had verloren) ik aan geen van deze eisen voldeed, besloot je mij toch aan te nemen, zonder ooit een officiële sollicitatiebrief van mij ontvangen te hebben. Hierbij hebben we van begin af aan de intentie en wederzijdse wens uitgesproken dat ik alsnog zou promoveren in Maastricht. Het verheugt mij dat ik met het afronden van mijn promotie de destijds gemaakte belofte eindelijk in kan lossen. Hartelijk bedankt voor het in mij gestelde vertrouwen. Ik hoop dat ik dit nog vele jaren mag blijven waarmaken.\\nBeste Walter, na jouw aanstelling als hoogleraar klinische fysica, heb ik je enkele jaren geleden gevraagd of je geïnteresseerd zou zijn om als mijn promotor op te treden. Hoewel jouw fysisch hart in eerste instantie bij MRI ligt, was jij hier graag toe bereid. Sinds die tijd heb je mij ontzettend gesteund en kon ik altijd met mijn vragen bij jou terecht. Jouw kritische kijk en feedback vanuit klinisch fysisch perspectief op mijn wetenschappelijke werk heeft mij meer dan eens uit mijn comfort zone gebracht, hetgeen uiteindelijk heeft geleid tot een aanzienlijke verbetering van de kwaliteit van mijn onderzoek. Ik denk dat onze samenwerking een mooi voorbeeld is hoe op een succesvolle manier invulling gegeven kan worden aan de fusie tussen radiologie en nucleaire geneeskunde. Ik wil je dan ook hartelijk danken voor al jouw inspanningen van de afgelopen jaren.\\nGerrit, dankzij jou kwam ik na mijn opleiding in een gespreid bedje binnen op de afdeling nucleaire geneeskunde van het MUMC+. Volgens mij heb ik je nooit gezegd hoezeer ik destijds twijfelde over mijn keuze om in jouw voetsporen als klinisch fysicus NG van een academisch ziekenhuis te treden, waarbij ik de angst had om als onervaren klinisch fysicus niet te kunnen voldoen alle verwachtingen die hier aan mij gesteld zou-den worden. Gedurende mijn eerste jaar in Maastricht ben jij nog een tijd aangebleven om mij wegwijs te maken binnen de afdeling en de rest van het MUMC+ en heb ik van jou nog veel mogen leren. Daarnaast was je zelfs bereid om na jouw pensionering als copromotor op te treden van mijn promotieonderzoek. Hierbij heb je me altijd geadviseerd om vooral mijn eigen keuzes te maken. Dank je wel hiervoor! Dear Prof. dr. Jentzen, dear Tinho, my research would not have been possible without our pleasant collaboration. During the last five years you have shared your tremendous amount of expertise in the field of 124 I PET quantification and lesion dosimetry with me. Thank you so much for all your help! I always enjoy visiting you in Essen to discuss our next research projects. I hope we will be able to collaborate for many years and nice projects to come.\\nBeste Anne en Antoon, nog tijdens mijn afstudeeronderzoek van mijn masteropleiding technische natuurkunde besloten jullie om mij, afkomstig uit het uiterste zuiden van het land, aan te nemen als klinisch fysicus in opleiding op de afdeling nucleaire geneeskunde en moleculaire beeldvorming binnen het UMCG in het hoge noorden.\\nTen tijde van het schrijven van dit dankwoord ontving ik helaas het droeve bericht van het overlijden van Anne. Anne, in de jaren dat jij mijn opleider was, heb ik op verschillende gebieden ontzettend veel van jou mogen leren, uiteenlopend van hoe je een fantoom homogeen met radioactiviteit vult, de (on)zin van het uitvoeren van periodieke metingen van de stralingsdosis op de afdeling NG, tot het aanbrengen van prioriteiten door gebruik te maken van het permanent archief. Nog elke dag ondervind ik hier veel profijt van. Het feit dat jij als één van de \\'founding fathers\\' van de PET in Nederland mijn opleider geweest bent, beschouw ik als een grote eer.\\nVanaf mijn eerste dag in het MUMC+ werd ik meteen opgenomen binnen de groep klinische fysica van de huidige afdeling beeldvorming. Walter, Eline, Cécile, Roald, Leonie en Harmen, de mogelijkheid om op fysisch inhoudelijk vlak met jullie te kunnen overleggen en periodiek elkaar op de hoogte te houden van relevante ontwikkelingen binnen het vakgebied, zie ik als een grote meerwaarde. Ik heb onze onderlinge samenwerking op klinisch fysisch gebied altijd als bijzonder prettig ervaren en ik hoop dan ook dat deze na de fusie alleen maar verder zal toenemen.\\nTevens wil ik al mijn collega\\'s bedanken die zich dagelijks inzetten op het gebied van de stralingsbescherming binnen de afdeling beeldvorming. Cécile, sinds begin 2016 zijn wij beiden gemandateerd als coördinerend stralingsdeskundige binnen het azM. Hierbij neem jij de röntgentoestellen voor jouw rekening en ik de radioactieve stoffen. Op deze manier hebben we de taken onderling goed verdeeld en kunnen we bij elkaar aankloppen wanneer dat nodig is. Ik hoop nog vele jaren samen met jou te kunnen optreden als coördinerend stralingsdeskundige van het azM. Maartje, al ruim vijf jaar werken wij nauw samen op het gebied van de stralingsbescherming binnen de nucleaire geneeskunde. Als toezichthoudend stralingsdeskundige ben jij niet alleen mijn rechterhand, maar ook mijn ogen en oren op de afdeling. Ik zou niet weten hoe ik zonder jouw aflatende inzet de tijd zou hebben gevonden om aan mijn wetenschappelijke projecten toe te kunnen komen. Dank je wel voor al het goede werk dat je elke dag weer verricht. Axel, Ellen, Hub, Marieke, jullie bijdrage als toezichthoudend stralingsdeskundige en/of medewerker van het dosimetriecentrum binnen de groep stralingshygiëne heeft de stralingsbescherming binnen de afdeling beeldvorming de afgelopen jaren tot een hoger niveau getild. Ik verheug me altijd op onze jaarlijkse barbecue. Daarnaast wil ik iedereen bedanken die zich de laatste jaren actief heeft ingezet binnen de commissie röntgentoestellen en radioactieve stoffen. Tot slot wil ik nog iedereen van het RNL en de SBE bedanken voor de onderlinge samenwerking van de afgelopen jaren.\\nNatuurlijk wil ik ook al mijn (oud-)collega\\'s van de afdeling beeldvorming die een bijdrage aan dit proefschrift hebben geleverd heel erg bedanken. In het bijzonder wil ik mijn dank uitspreken aan alle collega\\'s van team 2 (nucleaire geneeskunde) en het PET/MRI team voor de fijne samenwerking van de afgelopen jaren. Zonder jullie was dit proefschrift niet tot stand gekomen.\\nJoachim, dank je wel voor de mogelijkheid om na de fusie van de afdelingen radiologie en nucleaire geneeskunde mijn promotietraject voort te kunnen zetten binnen de nieuwe afdeling beeldvorming en alle steun die je hierbij hebt geleverd. Boudewijn, het idee om retrospectief laesiedosimetrie op de 124  I data in Maastricht uit te voeren was initieel jouw voorstel. Ik moet toegeven dat ik aanvankelijk enigszins sceptisch was over de haalbaarheid van dit project, maar gedurende het project bleek mijn initiële terughoudendheid ongegrond.\\nIvo, altijd ben jij bereid om mij te helpen wanneer ik activiteit nodig heb voor mijn (kwaliteits) metingen, bij het vullen van een fantoom of gewoon even ergens over van gedachten te wisselen. Tevens is jouw bijdrage aan het borgen van de kwaliteit van de laboratorium apparatuur cruciaal. Naast het feit dat je mijn collega en kamergenoot bent, beschouw ik je bovenal al geruime tijd als mijn vriend. Buiten het werk gaan we dan ook regelmatig met elkaar om. Ik hoop dat dit nog vele jaren zo mag blijven.\\nMatthias, meer dan eens heb ik jou de laatste tijd kunnen lastigvallen wanneer ik vragen had op het gebied van radiochemie of wanneer ik de behoefte had om de resultaten van mijn onderzoek met jou te bespreken. Omgekeerd weet jij mij regelmatig te vinden voor hulp op fysisch of stralingshygiënisch gebied. Ook koester ik de gezellige spelletjesavonden met onze groep die de afgelopen jaren georganiseerd zijn.\\nNaast mijn collega\\'s zijn mijn vrienden ontzettend belangrijk geweest tijdens mijn promotieonderzoek. Sergiy, wij leerden elkaar elf jaar geleden kennen tijdens onze opleiding tot klinisch fysicus in Groningen. Tijdens onze opleiding hebben wij ontzettend veel steun aan elkaar gehad en heeft zich een hechte vriendschap ontwikkeld. De manier waarop jij als geboren Oekraïner je in Nederland hebt ontwikkeld en aangepast is bijzonder indrukwekkend. Ook nu wij ver uit elkaar wonen en we elkaar helaas relatief weinig zien, houdt onze vriendschap stand. Ik realiseer mij dat dit zeker geen vanzelfsprekendheid is en hoop nog vele jaren bij jou op bezoek te mogen komen in Alkmaar.\\nMatthijs, onze vriendschap gaat helemaal terug tot aan de zandbak van de lagere kleuterklas van basisschool \"De Schacht\". Ik vind het ontzettend bijzonder hoe wij vanaf deze tijd nagenoeg hetzelfde traject in ons leven tot dusver hebben doorlopen. In Eindhoven waren we huisgenoten tijdens onze opleiding technische natuurkunde. Vervolgens besloten we allebei de opleiding tot klinisch fysicus te volgen, jij in Heerlen, ik in Groningen. En nu zullen we allebei in het voorjaar van 2018 vader worden. Ik hoop dat onze vriendschap nog vele jaren stand mag houden.\\nDennis, onze vriendschap ontstond twaalf jaar geleden tijdens ons afstudeerproject in het provisorium van het azM. Vanaf het eerste moment konden wij het erg goed met elkaar vinden. Ook na mijn vertrek richting Groningen hielden we contact en spraken we regelmatig met elkaar af waarbij jij en Priscilla ook vaker een bezoek bij mij in het verre Groningen brachten. Ik ben nog steeds ontzettend vereerd en trots dat jullie mij ruim vijf jaar geleden vroegen als peetoom van jullie tweede kind Babet. In mijn ogen is dit het ultieme symbool van vertrouwen en vriendschap.\\nUiteraard ben ik ontzettend veel dank verschuldigd aan mijn lieve familie en schoonfamilie.\\nAron, het is niet in woorden te beschrijven wat onze band voor mij betekent. Als grote broer sta jij altijd voor mij klaar, no matter what. Je bent niet alleen de beste broer die ik me kan wensen, maar zoveel meer dan dat. Je bent mijn allerbeste vriend en deze vriendschap is onvoorwaardelijk. Dit heeft zich de laatste jaren onder andere geuit in het feit dat jij en Annet besloten hebben om Marieke en mij als peettante en peetoom van jullie eerste kind Sverre te benoemen. Daarnaast was jij afgelopen zomer één van de twee getuigen op onze bruiloft. Met Sverre en Stijn hebben jij een Annet een fantastisch gezin opgebouwd en ik wens jullie niks dan goeds voor de toekomst.\\nPap en mam, het is vrijwel onmogelijk om jullie te bedanken voor alles dat jullie voor mij de afgelopen 34 jaar gedaan hebben. Bedankt voor jullie onvoorwaardelijke steun en liefde en alle mogelijkheden die jullie mij gegeven hebben om mijzelf te ontwikkelen. Nog steeds staan jullie altijd voor mij klaar wanneer ik raad nodig heb of er weer eens geklust moet worden in ons huisje. Ik hou van jullie.\\nTot slot mijn lieve vrouw Marieke. Inmiddels zijn we al vijf jaar ontzettend gelukkig samen. Sinds afgelopen zomer heb ik bovendien de grote eer om je mijn vrouw te mogen noemen. Ik weet dat de afgelopen maanden voor ons niet makkelijk zijn geweest. Het afronden van mijn proefschrift betekende dat ik jou de afgelopen periode niet altijd de aandacht en tijd kon geven die je verdient, maar ondanks alles heb je mij altijd gesteund. Ik zal nooit vergeten hoe je mij in de eerste week van augustus 2017 vertelde dat je zwanger bent van ons eerste kindje. Hoewel de zwangerschap fysiek een zware belasting voor je is, blijf je altijd positief en vol goede moed. Je doet het supergoed en ik\\nThe authors thank Dr. A.J. van der Molen, Leiden University Medical Center, for his assistance in gathering part of the relevant literature.\\nThe dose-response relationship in a fixed-activity approach generally applied in the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer was assessed using\\nThe aim was to investigate the quantitative performance of 124 I PET/MRI for pretherapeutic lesion dosimetry in differentiated thyroid cancer. Phantom measurements were performed on a PET/MRI system (Biograph mMR, Siemens Healthcare) using 124 I and 18 F. The PET calibration factor and the influence of radiofrequency coil attenuation were determined using a cylindrical phantom homogeneously filled with radioactivity. The calibration factor was 1.00 ± 0.02 for Supplemental materials  \\nIn the design of nuclear medicine treatment and examination rooms, an important consideration is the shielding required for ionizing radiation from the radioactive isotopes used. The shielding in the walls is normally limited to a height lower than the actual ceiling height. The direct radiation, possible with buildup correction, can be calculated relatively easily. However, little data is available to estimate the dose contribution from ionizing radiation traveling over the wall shielding and scattering off the ceiling. We aim to determine the contribution of the ceiling scatter to the radiation dose outside nuclear medicine rooms.\\nMonte Carlo simulations were performed using Gate for different heights of lead shielding in the wall, and different ceiling heights. A point source in air of 99m Tc (141 keV), 131 I (365 keV) or 18 F (511 keV) was placed 1.0 m above the floor, 3.0 m from the lead shielding. Simulations of ceiling scatter only and for the total radiation dose were performed for these 3 isotopes, 5 different ceiling heights and 4-8 different wall shielding heights, resulting in a total of 165 simulations. This allowed us to compare the contribution of the radiation passing through the shielding and the ceiling scatter.\\nWe find that the shielding required for the primary radiation, measured in half-value layers, is an important factor in determining the relative contribution of ceiling scatter. When more than about 4 half-value layers of shielding are used, ceiling scatter becomes the dominant factor and should be taken into account in the shielding design. In many practical cases for low energy photons (e.g. from 99m Tc; 141 keV; half-value layer of 0.26 mm lead), 2 mm of lead is used and ceiling scatter is a dominant factor contributing >~70% of the dose outside the shielded room. For higher energies (e.g. 18 F; 511 keV; half-value layer of 3.9 mm lead) the ceiling scatter is typically less than about 15% when 8 mm of lead shielding is used.\\nWe have performed simulations that allow an estimation of the contribution of ceiling scatter to the radiation dose outside a room, based on the ceiling height, shielding height and isotope used. This will allow for improved shielding designs in nuclear medicine departments.\\nThe authors have no relevant conflicts of interest to disclose. \\n\\n\\nRoel Wierts was born on March 30 th 1983 in Heerlen, the Netherlands.

    "# text=\"\"\"Thyroid cancer is divided into differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and undifferentiated thyroid cancer. In contrast to the undifferentiated thyroid cancer, the vast majority of the DTC accumulates iodine in the tumour cells. Utilizing this characteristic, DTC patients can undergo radioiodine therapy (RIT). RIT of DTC patients provides a very effective therapy with only minimal side effects using standard activities, which is established for more than half a century. Patients are treated according to their tumour stage. Low-risk patients usually undergo a single RIT with activities up to 4 GBq 131 I. High-risk patients undergo at least one or several RIT with higher activities [1,2]. While performing RIT with high activities of 131 I, the organs at risk need specific attention. These are the bone marrow and the lung, especially in case of multiple metastases. The amount of 131 I activity and the number of RIT depend on the results of the first RIT: if metastases were detected in the posttherapeutic scan, further RIT may be necessary for an effective treatment of metastases. Therefore, a pretherapeutic diagnostic, which detects iodine avid metastases, is desirable. The same holds for the first RIT for patients with a high likelihood for metastases. The pretherapeutic risk stratification is one of the greatest challenges in treating DTC patients. Although the overall prognosis for the most DTC patients is excellent [3], unfortunately, some DTC patients suffer from recurrences or persistent disease. These patients have already undergone RIT. In cases of recurrent or persistent disease, the cancer cells often show less up to none radioiodine uptake. Patients with low or missing radioiodine uptake would not or would only slightly benefit from an additional RIT [4]. Therefore, the knowledge of the localization and the radioiodine uptake level of lesions have great influence on therapy decision and the amount of therapeutic activity.\n",
    "# Pretherapeutic imaging of DTC patients can be performed with different radioiodine isotopes and the corresponding imaging modalities. 131 I as diagnostic isotope is used since decades. Usually, activities up to 185 MBq 131 I are administered [5]. Another radioiodine isotope for pretherapeutic imaging is 123 I, which is hardly used due to its lower imaging sensitivity and higher costs [5]. Both isotopes can be visualized by planar scintigraphies with a gamma camera or as 3D imaging with a single photon emission tomography (SPECT) camera. Compared to positron emission tomography (PET), the spatial resolution of gamma cameras is lower. However, radioiodine diagnostics using 131 I prior to intended RIT is not advisable mainly for two reasons. First, until today it is not possible to derive reliable lesion dosimetry data from 131 I scans. Second, 131 I imaging needs relative high activities resulting in high radiation doses. It is well known, that this leads to a so called stunning and, thus, reduces the response of subsequent RIT [6]. 124 I PET in combination with computed tomography (CT) overcomes both problems. It offers optimal imaging to detect radioiodine uptake in tumour cells before patients undergo RIT, while only low 124 I activities are required compared to 131 I imaging [7][8][9][10][11]. Stunning is unlikely and was not reported yet [5]. In addition, pretherapeutic 124 I diagnostic provides, in comparison with 131 I and 123 I, a higher quantitative capacity to perform a reliable lesion dosimetry. This enables a tailor-made RIT with optimized absorbed tumour doses and an 131 I activity, which is considered to be safe for the patient, based on the blood dosimetry.\n",
    "# There are two important requirements for a successful performance of124 I PET(/CT) diagnostics or RIT: First, all patients are put on a low iodine diet. This is important to increase the radioiodine uptake of the tumour cells. After performing a CT scan with contrast agents containing iodine, for example, the tumour cells are saturated with iodine and would show only a low radioiodine uptake. Therefore, any iodine contamination has to be avoided to ensure a good radioiodine uptake during diagnostic imaging or therapy. Second, the tumour cells have to be stimulated to achieve a high radioiodine uptake. The increase of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) can be reached on two ways: endogenous or exogenous stimulation. The endogenous stimulation is usually chosen after initial thyroidectomy. Patients have to stay on hormone withdrawal for about 4 weeks, until the TSH serum concentration exceeds 30 mU/l [2,5]. During this time, patients may experience hypothyroid symptoms such as fatigue, listlessness, depression and concentration disorders. The other way is an exogenous stimulation with recombinant human TSH (rhTSH). The rhTSH is administered via an intramuscular injection two and one day before diagnostic imaging or treatment. The exogenous stimulation spares patients having the hypothyroid symptoms. Moreover, a lower blood dose was reported in rhTSH stimulated patients [12,13] compared to endogenous stimulation. However, the equivalence of therapeutic efficiency concerning tumour elimination under rhTSH stimulation is not proven. 124 I is a positron emitting nuclide with a half-life of 4.2 days. Like many other positron emitting nuclides, 124 I is produced in a cyclotron. Under endogenous or exogenous TSH stimulation, 124 I can be administered in two different ways: orally or intravenously. The amount of administered 124 I activities reported in the literature is between 25 MBq and 74 MBq [7,14,15].\n",
    "# In the time of combined PET/CT scanners, it is much easier to locate focal radioiodine uptake for example in the neck [16]. The new scanner generation provides fast scans with an acquisition time of e.g. 15 min for a scan from thigh to head. Besides the scan parameters and the scanner properties, the time point of scan is very important. In the beginning of 124 I PET(/CT) imaging, multiple scans were performed at 4, 24, 48, 72, and ≥96 h after 124 I application. This time and resource consuming approach has been optimized and the necessary scans could be reduced to 2 time points: 24 and 96 h after 124 I application [14]. The first scan 24 h after 124 I application enables the detection of focal pathological iodine uptake as correlate for metastases or local relapse. This scan is sufficient for diagnostic purpose. The first and second scans are mainly needed for lesion dosimetry to estimate the lesion absorbed (radiation) dose during RIT (details see below). However, occasionally, weakly radioiodine accumulating metastases only show uptake in the late scan.\n",
    "# The RIT is crucial for an effective treatment of DTC [17,18]. Patients with higher initial tumour stage or advanced disease with lymph node or distant metastases routinely undergo RIT with higher 131 I activities or several RIT. The knowledge of metastases prior to first RIT would be beneficial for therapy planning. If no metastases are present, lower activities of 131 I would be reasonable. Patients with many metastases, especially bone or pulmonary metastases, should be treated carefully because of bone marrow toxicity and the risk of radiation-related pneumonitis or lung fibrosis [19,20].\n",
    "# Another advantage of pretherapeutic 124 I PET is the re-staging and especially up-staging in patients with suspect findings in sonography. Shortly before RIT (about three weeks after thyroidectomy) patients should undergo sonography of the neck. If conspicuous lymph nodes are present, additional clarification is necessary to adapt therapy management. In this process, 124 I PET offers the possibility to detect focal iodine uptake in case of lymph node metastases and therapy activity of 131 I can be adapted. If no radioiodine uptake was found in conspicuous lymph nodes, it might be a reactive lymph node or a radioiodine negative lymph node metastasis; both will not be affected by the RIT.\n",
    "# During the first RIT, there is usually focal radioiodine uptake in the thyroid bed in accordance with thyroid remnant tissues. Other focal radioiodine uptake located beyond the thyroid bed is suspicious for malignancy, for example in the neck is typical for lymph node metastases.\n",
    "# In the clinical course of patients with DTC, some patients suffer from tumour persistence after initial RIT or experience a relapse of DTC at a later stage. These patients mostly present an elevated and/or increasing serum level of thyroglobulin. Sometimes new tissue in the thyroid bed or suspect lymph nodes can be detected in sonography of the neck as a correlate. The most preferable therapy option would be an additional RIT in these cases. Unfortunately, thyroid cancer cells can dedifferentiate and partially or completely lose the ability to accumulate iodine. These patients with the so-called radioiodine negative metastases do not or only slightly profit from additional RIT. Other therapies such as surgery or external beam radiotherapy would be the therapy of choice in radioiodine negative metastases. But not all patients are radioiodine negative in case of recurrent disease. Therefore, a selection must be performed prior to futile RIT.\n",
    "# After initial RIT and thyroid remnant ablation, no pathological focal iodine uptake should be visible. Therefore, every focal uptake, for example in the neck or lung, is highly suspect for metastases or local relapse (except physiological uptake, e.g. in the salivary glands).\n",
    "# Within the last years, simultaneous PET/MRI (PET/magnetic resonance imaging) has been successfully implemented into scientific and clinical imaging, demonstrating its excellent diagnostic potential, mainly in oncologic imaging. Based on its excellent soft tissue contrast, MRI is known to provide superior assessment of head and neck tumours and with the increasing implementation of integrated whole-body PET/MR devices, combining the strength of PET as well as morphological and functional MRI. In this assessment, it could be of great advantage in the localization of focal iodine uptake. The first publication about simultaneous 124 I PET/MRI showed promising results [21].\n",
    "# The 124 I dosimetry deals with the determination of tumour lesion dose per administered 131 I activity (LDpA) and the estimation of the so-called maximum tolerable activity (MTA) of 131 I. The LDpA can help in the decision process if an additional RIT is a promising approach. If a prescribed lesion dose seems to be reachable, the RIT is combined with a significant chance of cure [22][23][24]. Due to the heterogeneity of metastases of a patient, there may be a significant spread of LDpA in the different metastases. In consequence, RIT might be helpful in some metastases and the other metastases need to be treated by surgery or external beam radiotherapy.\n",
    "# The MTA derived from blood dosimetry is the 131 I activity that results in 2 Gy blood dose, which is used as a surrogate for the bone marrow dose. Blood doses below 2 Gy are expected to be tolerable without relevant side effects [19]. Furthermore, it is possible to evaluate the risk of radiation-related fibrosis in patients with or without disseminated lung metastases [19,20]. The blood dosimetry is based on blood sample (BS) and whole-body counter (WC) measurements (see Figures 123).   The lesion and blood dosimetry consists of measurements at different time points after application of 124 I to determine the iodine kinetics. The lesion dosimetry requires a minimum of two PET(/CT) scans at 24 and ≥96 h after 124 I application. The blood dosimetry by the EANM dosimetry committee uses a comprehensive protocol with measurements over at least 4 days [25], which was optimized and shortened by Jentzen et al. [26]. For the optimized blood dosimetry protocols, patients are divided into the groups prior to first RIT and after first RIT. Prior to initial RIT, more measurements are recommended due to the presence of thyroid tissue. After the first RIT, only three time points are sufficient. In Figure 4, the required measurements are visualized. Further details on the calculations of lesion and blood dosimetry can be found in Jentzen et al. [14,26] (see examples in Figures 5 and6).  \n",

In contrast to the undifferentiated thyroid cancer, the vast majority of the DTC accumulates iodine in the tumour cells. Utilizing this characteristic, DTC patients can undergo radioiodine therapy (RIT). RIT of DTC patients provides a very effective therapy with only minimal side effects using standard activities, which is established for more than half a century. Patients are treated according to their tumour stage. Low-risk patients usually undergo a single RIT with activities up to 4 GBq 131 I.
